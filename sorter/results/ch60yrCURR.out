(2) Allocation authority
Subject to paragraph (1), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas the use of which has been prohibited by the President pursuant to authority under section 717z of this title (relating to the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel during any natural gas supply emergency).

(c) Allocation of general pipeline supply

(1) Required findings

(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries;
(E) such allocation will not create, for the interstate pipeline delivering certificated natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such pipeline to be unable to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas served, directly or indirectly, by such pipeline; and
(F) such allocation will not result in a disproportionate share of deliveries and resulting curtailments of natural gas being experienced by such interstate pipeline when compared to deliveries and resulting curtailments which are experienced as a result of orders issued under this subsection applicable to other interstate pipelines (as determined by the President).

(2) Required notification from State

(A) 2 Notification
The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he is notified by the Governor of any State that—
(i) a shortage of natural gas supplies available to such State exists or is imminent;
(ii) such shortage or imminent shortage endangers the supply of natural gas for high-priority uses in such State; and
(iii) the exercise of authority under State law is inadequate to protect high-priority uses of natural gas in such State from an interruption in natural gas supplies.

(3) Basis of finding
To the maximum extent practicable, the Governor shall submit, together with any notification under subparagraph (A), information upon which he has based his finding under such subparagraph, including—
(i) volumes of natural gas required to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas in such State;

(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries; and
(E) such allocation will not create, for the person who owns and would otherwise use such natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such person to be unable to satisfy such person's natural gas requirements for high-priority uses.

(2) Allocation authority
Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas which would be certificated natural gas but for the second sentence of section 3301(19) of this title.

(2) Calculation of compensation for certain boiler fuel natural gas
For purposes of any supplemental order under paragraph (1) with respect to emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (b), the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
(A) for supplies of natural gas based upon the amount required to make whole the user subject to the prohibition order, but in no event may such compensation exceed just compensation prescribed in section 717z of this title; and
(B) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President.

(3) Compensation for other natural gas allocated
For the purpose of any supplemental order under paragraph (1), if the party making emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (c) or (d)—
(A) indicates a preference for compensation in kind, the President shall direct that compensation in kind be provided as expeditiously as practicable;
(B) indicates a preference for compensation, or the President determines that, notwithstanding paragraph (A) of this subsection, any portion thereof cannot practicably be compensated in kind, the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
(i) for supplies of natural gas, based upon the amount required to make the pipeline and its local distribution companies whole, in the case of any order under subsection (c), or to make the user from whom natural gas is allocated whole, in the case of any order under subsection (d) including any amount actually paid by such pipeline and its local distribution companies or such user for volumes of natural gas or higher cost synthetic gas acquired to replace natural gas subject to an order under subsection (c) or (d); and
