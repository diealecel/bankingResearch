§661. Congressional declaration of policy
It is declared to be the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this chapter to improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular by establishing a program to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply: Provided, however, That this policy shall be carried out in such manner as to insure the maximum participation of private financing sources.
It is the intention of the Congress that the provisions of this chapter shall be so administered that any financial assistance provided hereunder shall not result in a substantial increase of unemployment in any area of the country. It is the intention of the Congress that in the award of financial assistance under this chapter, when practicable, priority be accorded to small business concerns which lease or purchase equipment and supplies which are produced in the United States and that small business concerns receiving such assistance be encouraged to continue to lease or purchase such equipment and supplies.

To encourage the formation and growth of small business investment companies the Administration is authorized (but only to the extent that the necessary funds are not available to said company from private sources on reasonable terms) when authorized in appropriation Acts, to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on, debentures or participating securities issued by such companies. Such purchases or guarantees may be made by the Administration on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, pursuant to regulations issued by the Administration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. Debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this subsection shall be subordinate to any other debenture bonds, promissory notes, or other debts and obligations of such companies, unless the Administration in its exercise of reasonable investment prudence and in considering the financial soundness of such company determines otherwise. Such debentures may be issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years and shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such debentures, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes. The debentures or participating securities shall also contain such other terms as the Administration may fix, and shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations:
(1) The total amount of debentures and participating securities that may be guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding from a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall not exceed 300 per centum of the private capital of such company: Provided, That nothing in this paragraph shall require any such company that on March 31, 1993, has outstanding debentures in excess of 300 per centum of its private capital to prepay such excess: And provided further, That any such company may apply for an additional debenture guarantee or participating security guarantee with the proceeds to be used solely to pay the amount due on such maturing debenture, but the maturity of the new debenture or security shall be not later than September 30, 2002.
(2) After March 31, 1993, the maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall be determined by the amount of such company's private capital—
(A) if the company has private capital of not more than $15,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed 300 per centum of private capital;
(B) if the company has private capital of more than $15,000,000 but not more than $30,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed $45,000,000 plus 200 per centum of the amount of private capital over $15,000,000; and
(C) if the company has private capital of more than $30,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed $75,000,000 plus 100 per centum of the amount of private capital over $30,000,000 but not to exceed an additional $15,000,000.
(3) Subject to the foregoing dollar and percentage limits, a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title may issue and have outstanding both guaranteed debentures and participating securities: Provided, That the total amount of participating securities outstanding shall not exceed 200 per centum of private capital.
(4) In no event shall the aggregate amount of outstanding leverage of any such company or companies which are commonly controlled as determined by the Administration exceed $90,000,000, unless the Administration determines on a case by case basis to permit a higher amount for companies under common control and imposes such additional terms and conditions as it determines appropriate to minimize the risk of loss to the Administration in the event of default.
For purposes of this subsection, the term “venture capital” includes such common stock, preferred stock, or other financing with subordination or nonamortization characteristics as the Administration determines to be substantially similar to equity financing.

(c) Purchase and guarantee operations of Administration
Subject to the following conditions, the Administration is authorized to purchase securities, and to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest payments as scheduled, on debentures issued by small business investment companies operating under the authority of section 681(d) of this title. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. As used in this subsection, the term “securities” means shares of nonvoting stock or other corporate securities or limited partnership interests which have similar characteristics.
(1) The Administration may purchase such securities: Provided, That—
(A) dividends are preferred and cumulative to the extent of 3 per centum of par value per annum, except as provided in paragraph (5);

(A) such debentures are issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years;
(B) the interest rate is determined pursuant to this section or section 687i of this title; and
(C) the amount of debentures purchased or guaranteed and outstanding at any one time pursuant to this paragraph (2) from a company having combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of less than $500,000 shall not exceed 300 per centum of its combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus less the amount of preferred securities outstanding under paragraph (1) of this subsection, nor from a company having combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of $500,000 or more, 400 per centum of its combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus less the amount of such preferred securities.
(3) Debentures purchased and outstanding pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be retired simultaneously with the issuance of preferred securities to meet the requirements of subparagraph (2)(C) of this subsection (c).
(4) The Administration may require, as a condition of the purchase or guarantee of any securities in excess of 300 per centum of the combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of a company, that the company maintain a percentage of its total funds available for investment in small business concerns invested or legally committed in venture capital (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) determined by the Administration to be reasonable and appropriate.
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, securities purchased by the Administration on or after November 21, 1989, (A) shall provide that dividends shall be preferred and cumulative to the extent of 4 per centum of par value per annum and (B) shall include a provision requiring the issuer to redeem such securities, including any accrued and unpaid dividends, in 15 years from the date of issuance: Provided, That the Administration may, in its discretion, guarantee debentures in such amounts as will permit the simultaneous redemption of such securities, including such amounts as it deems appropriate to include all or any part of accrued and unpaid dividends: Provided further, That the Administration shall not pay any part of the interest on such debentures except pursuant to its guarantee in the event of default in payment by the issuer.
(6) In no event shall the Administration purchase or guarantee debentures or securities under the provisions of this subchapter, if the amount of outstanding securities and debentures of a company operating under the authority of section 681(d) of this title would exceed 400 per centum of its combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus or $35,000,000, which ever 1 is less, except as provided in paragraph (7).
(7) The Administration may guarantee debentures or may guarantee the payment of the redemption price and prioritized payments on participating securities under subsection (g) of this section from a company operating under section 681(d) of this title in amounts above $35,000,000 but not to exceed the maximum amounts specified in subsection (b) of this section subject to the following:

If the Administration guarantees debentures issued by a small business investment company operating under authority of section 681(d) of this title, it shall make, on behalf of the company payments in such amounts as will reduce the effective rate of interest to be paid by the company during the first five years of the term of such debentures to a rate of interest 3 points below the market rate of interest determined pursuant to section 687l of this title. Such payments shall be made by the Administration to the holder of the debenture, its agents or assigns, or to the appropriate central registration agent, if any. The authority to reduce interest rates as provided in this subsection shall be limited to amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts, and the total amount shall be reserved within the business loan and investment fund to pay an amount equal to the amount of the reduction as it becomes due.

In determining the private capital of a small business investment company licensed under section 681(d) of this title and notwithstanding section 662(9) of this title, Federal, State, or local government funds received from sources other than the Administration shall be included solely for regulatory purposes, and not for the purpose of obtaining financial assistance from or licensing by the Administration, providing such funds were invested to 2 November 21, 1989: Provided, That such companies may include in private capital for any purpose funds indirectly obtained from State or local governments. As used in this subsection, the term “capital indirectly obtained” includes income generated by a State financing authority or similar State institution or agency or from the investment of State or local money or amounts originally provided to nonprofit institutions or corporations which such institutions or corporations, in their discretion, determine to invest in a company licensed under section 681(d) of this title.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation, the Administration is authorized to allow the issuer of any preferred stock heretofore sold to the Administration to redeem or repurchase such stock upon the payment to the Administration of an amount less than the par value of such stock. The Administration, in its sole discretion, shall determine the repurchase price after considering factors including, but not limited to, the market value of the stock, the value of benefits previously provided and anticipated to accrue to the issuer, the amount of dividends previously paid, accrued, and anticipated, and the Administration's estimate of any anticipated redemption. The Administration may guarantee debentures as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (c) of this section and allow the issuer to use the proceeds to make the payments authorized herein. Any monies received by the Administration from the repurchase of preferred stock shall be deposited in the business loan and investment fund and shall be available solely to provide assistance to companies operating under the authority of section 681(d) of this title, to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts.

(g) Guarantee of payment of and authority to purchase participating securities
In order to encourage small business investment companies to provide equity capital to small businesses, the Administration is authorized to guarantee the payment of the redemption price and prioritized payments on participating securities issued by such companies which are licensed pursuant to section 681(c) of this title, and a trust or a pool acting on behalf of the Administration is authorized to purchase such securities. Such guarantees and purchases shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Administration shall establish by regulation. For purposes of this section, (A) the term “participating securities” includes preferred stock, a preferred limited partnership interest or a similar instrument, including debentures under the terms of which interest is payable only to the extent of earnings and (B) the term “prioritized payments” includes dividends on stock, interest on qualifying debentures, or priority returns on preferred limited partnership interests which are paid only to the extent of earnings. Participating securities guaranteed under this subsection shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations, in addition to such other restrictions and limitations as the Administration may determine:
(1) Participating securities shall be redeemed not later than 15 years after their date of issuance for an amount equal to 100 per centum of the original issue price plus the amount of any accrued prioritized payment: Provided, That if, at the time the securities are redeemed, whether as scheduled or in advance, the issuing company (A) has not paid all accrued prioritized payments in full as provided in paragraph (2) below and (B) has not sold or otherwise disposed of all investments subject to profit distributions pursuant to paragraph (11), the company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall continue and payment shall be made from the realized gain, if any, on the disposition of such investments, but if on disposition there is no realized gain, the obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall be extinguished: Provided further, That in the interim, the company shall not make any in-kind distributions of such investments unless it pays to the Administration such sums, up to the amount of the unrealized appreciation on such investments, as may be necessary to pay in full the accrued prioritized payments.
(2) Prioritized payments on participating securities shall be preferred and cumulative and payable out of the retained earnings available for distribution, as defined by the Administration, of the issuing company at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such securities, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus, at the time the guarantee is issued, such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes, but not to exceed 2 per centum.
(3) In the event of liquidation of the company, participating securities shall be senior in priority for all purposes to all other equity interests in the issuing company, whenever created.
(4) Any company issuing a participating security under this subsection shall commit to invest or shall invest and maintain an amount equal to the outstanding face value of such security solely in equity capital. As used in this subsection, “equity capital” means common or preferred stock or a similar instrument, including subordinated debt with equity features which is not amortized and which provides for interest payments contingent upon and limited to the extent of earnings.
(5) The only debt (other than leverage obtained in accordance with this subchapter) which any company issuing a participating security under this subsection may have outstanding shall be temporary debt in amounts limited to not more than 50 per centum of private capital.
(6) The Administration may permit the proceeds of a participating security to be used to pay the principal amount due on outstanding debentures guaranteed by the Administration, if (A) the company has outstanding equity capital invested in an amount equal to the amount of the debentures being refinanced and (B) the Administration receives profit participation on such terms and conditions as it may determine, but not to exceed the per centums specified in paragraph (11).
(7) For purposes of computing profit participation under paragraph (11), except as otherwise determined by the Administration, the management expenses of any company which issues participating securities shall not be greater than 2.5 per centum per annum of the combined capital of the company, plus $125,000 if the company's combined capital is less than $20,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) the term “combined capital” means the aggregate amount of private capital and outstanding leverage and (B) the term “management expenses” includes salaries, office expenses, travel, business development, office and equipment rental, bookkeeping and the development, investigation and monitoring of investments, but does not include the cost of services provided by specialized outside consultants, outside lawyers and outside auditors, who perform services not generally expected of a venture capital company nor does such term include the cost of services provided by any affiliate of the company which are not part of the normal process of making and monitoring venture capital investments.
(8) Notwithstanding paragraph (9), if a company is operating as a limited partnership or as a subchapter s 3 corporation or an equivalent pass-through entity for tax purposes and if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments, the company may make annual distributions to the partners or shareholders in amounts not greater than each partner's or shareholder's maximum tax liability. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “maximum tax liability” means the amount of income allocated to each partner or shareholder (including an allocation to the Administration as if it were a taxpayer) for Federal income tax purposes in the income tax return filed or to be filed by the company with respect to the fiscal year of the company immediately preceding such distribution, multiplied by the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rates for corporations or individuals, whichever is higher, on each type of income included in such return. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “State income tax” means the income tax of the State where the company's principal place of business is located.
(9) After making any distributions as provided in paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may distribute the balance of income to its investors, specifically including the Administration, in the per centums specified in paragraph (11), if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full, subject to the following conditions:
(A) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, any amounts distributed shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of leverage to private capital.
(B) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 100 per centum but not more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, 50 per centum of any amounts distributed shall be made to the Administration and 50 per centum shall be made to the private investors.
(C) If the amount of leverage outstanding is 100 per centum, or less, of the amount of private capital, the ratio shall be that for distribution of profits as provided in paragraph (11).
(D) Any amounts received by the Administration under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be applied first as profit participation as provided in paragraph (11) and any remainder shall be applied as a prepayment of the principal amount of the participating securities or debentures.
(10) After making any distributions pursuant to paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may return capital to its investors, specifically including the Administration, if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full. Any distributions under this paragraph shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of private capital to leverage as of the date of the proposed distribution: Provided, That if the amount of leverage outstanding is less than 50 per centum of the amount of private capital or $10,000,000, whichever is less, no distribution shall be required to be made to the Administration unless the Administration determines, on a case by case basis, to require distributions to the Administration to reduce the amount of outstanding leverage to an amount less than $10,000,000.
(11)(A) A company which issues participating securities shall agree to allocate to the Administration a share of its profits determined by the relationship of its private capital to the amount of participating securities guaranteed by the Administration in accordance with the following:
(i) If the total amount of participating securities is 100 per centum of private capital or less, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows: the amount of participating securities divided by private capital times 9 per centum.
(ii) If the total amount of participating securities is more than 100 per centum but not greater than 200 per centum of private capital, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows:
(I) 9 per centum, plus
(II) 3 per centum of the amount of participating securities minus private capital divided by private capital.
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph—
(i) in no event shall the total per centum required by this paragraph exceed 12 per centum, unless required pursuant to the provisions of (ii) below,
(ii) if, on the date the participating securities are marketed, the interest rate on Treasury bonds with a maturity of 10 years is a rate other than 8 per centum, the Administration shall adjust the rate specified in paragraph (A) above, either higher or lower, by the same per centum by which the Treasury bond rate is higher or lower than 8 per centum, and
(iii) this paragraph shall not be construed to create any ownership interest of the Administration in the company.
(12) A company may elect to make an in-kind distribution of securities only if such securities are publicly traded and marketable. The company shall deposit the Administration's share of such securities for disposition with a trustee designated by the Administration or, at its option and with the agreement of the company, the Administration may direct the company to retain the Administration's share. If the company retains the Administration's share, it shall sell the Administration's share and promptly remit the proceeds to the Administration. As used in this paragraph, the term “trustee” means a person who is knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded securities.
(13) Participating securities for smaller small business investment companies.—
(A) In general.—Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), of the amount of the annual program level of participating securities approved in appropriations Acts, 50 percent shall be reserved for funding small business investment companies with private capital of not more than $20,000,000.
(B) Exception.—During the last quarter of each fiscal year, if the Administrator determines that there is a lack of qualified applicants with private capital of not more than $20,000,000, the Administrator may utilize all or any part of the program level for securities reserved under subparagraph (A) for qualified applicants with private capital of more than $20,000,000.

(h) Computation of amounts due under participating securities
The computation of amounts due the Administration under participating securities shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
(1) The formula in subsection (g)(11) of this section shall be computed annually and the Administration shall receive distributions of its profit participation at the same time as other investors in the company.
(2) The formula shall not be modified due to an increase in the private capital unless the increase is provided for in a proposed business plan submitted to and approved by the Administration.
(3) After distributions have been made, the Administration's share of such distributions shall not be recomputed or reduced.

(5) If a company is licensed on or before March 31, 1993, it may elect to exclude from profit participation all investments held on that date and in such case the Administration shall determine the amount of the future expenses attributable to such prior investment: Provided, That if the company issues participating securities to refinance debentures as authorized in subsection (g)(6) of this section, it may not elect to exclude profits on existing investments under this paragraph.

(a) Grounds for suspension or revocation
A license may be revoked or suspended by the Administration—
(1) for false statements knowingly made in any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administration;
(2) if any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administrator, fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which the statement was made;
(3) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of this chapter;
(4) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any rule or regulation of the Administration authorized by this chapter; or
(5) for violation of, or failure to observe, any cease and desist order issued by the Administration under this section.

(b) Grounds for cease and desist order
Where a licensee or any other person has not complied with any provision of this chapter, or of any regulation issued pursuant thereto by the Administration, or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of such chapter or regulation, the Administration may order such licensee or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administration may further order such licensee or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administration deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter and the regulations. The Administration may also suspend the license of a licensee, against whom an order has been issued, until such licensee complies with such order.

(c) Order to show cause; contents; hearing; issuance and service
Before revoking or suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Administration shall serve upon the licensee and any other person involved an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee and any other person involved.

(d) Subpena of person, and books, papers and documents; fees and mileage; enforcement
The Administration may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, and documents relating to the hearing from any place in the United States. Witnesses summoned before the Administration shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Administration, or any party to a proceeding before the Administration, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents.

(e) Petition to modify or set aside order; filing, time and place, Administration to submit record; action of court; review
An order issued by the Administration under this section shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days after the service thereof the licensee, or other person against whom an order is issued, appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such licensee has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the Administration's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition. After the expiration of such thirty days, a petition may be filed only by leave of court on a showing of reasonable grounds for failure to file the petition theretofore. The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Administration, and the Administration shall thereupon certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Administration. If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the Administration to reopen the hearing for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Administration may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the record of such additional evidence. No objection to an order of the Administration shall be considered by the court unless such objection was urged before the Administration or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside any such order of the Administration shall be subject only to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certification or certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

(f) Enforcement of order
If any licensee or other person against which or against whom an order is issued under this section fails to obey the order, the Administration may apply to the United States court of appeals, within the circuit where the licensee has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of the application the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the licensee or other person. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in subsection (e) of this section for applications to set aside or modify orders.

§687b. Investigations and examinations; power to subpena and take oaths and affirmations; aid of courts; examiners; reports

(a) Investigation of violations
The Administration may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a licensee, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.

(b) Examinations and reports
Each small business investment company shall be subject to examinations made by direction of the Investment Division of the Administration, and the cost of such examinations, including the compensation of the examiners, may in the discretion of the Administration be assessed against the company examined and when so assessed shall be paid by such company. Every such company shall make such reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require; except that the Administration is authorized to exempt from making such reports any such company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.] to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in reporting requirements.

(c) Examinations of small business investment companies
Each small business investment company shall be examined at least every two years in such detail so as to determine whether or not—
(1) it has engaged solely in lawful activities and those contemplated by this subchapter;
(2) it has engaged in prohibited conflicts of interest;
(3) it has acquired or exercised illegal control of an assisted small business;
(4) it has made investments in small businesses for not less than four years in the case of section 301(d) [15 U.S.C. 681(d)] licensees and in all other cases, not less than five years;
(5) it has invested more than 20 per centum of its capital in any individual small business, if such restriction is applicable;
(6) it has engaged in relending, foreign investments, or passive investments; or
(7) it has charged an interest rate in excess of the maximum permitted by law:
Provided, That the Administration may waive the examination (A) for up to one additional year if, in its discretion, it determines such a delay would be appropriate, based upon the amount of debentures being issued by the company and its repayment record, the prior operating experience of the company, the contents and results of the last examination and the management expertise of the company, or (B) if it is a company whose operations have been suspended while the company is involved in litigation or is in receivership.

(d) Valuation guidelines and responsibility
Each small business investment company shall adopt written guidelines for determination of the value of investments made by such company. The board of directors of corporations and the general partners of partnerships shall have the sole responsibility for making a good faith determination of the fair market value of the investments made by such company. Determinations shall be made and reported to the Administration not less than semiannually or at more frequent intervals as the Administration determines appropriate: Provided, That any company which does not have outstanding financial assistance under the provisions of this subchapter shall be required to make such determinations and reports to the Administration annually, unless the Administration, in its discretion, determines otherwise.

§687c. Injunctions and other orders

(a) Grounds; jurisdiction of court
Whenever, in the judgment of the Administration, a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter, the Administration may make application to the proper district court of the United States or a United States court of any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for an order enjoining such acts or practices, or for an order enforcing compliance with such provision, rule, regulation, or order, and such courts shall have jurisdiction of such actions and, upon a showing by the Administration that such licensee or other person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order, shall be granted without bond.

(b) Equity jurisdiction of licensee and assets thereof
In any such proceeding the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary, take exclusive jurisdiction of the licensee or licensees and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction in any such proceeding to appoint a trustee or receiver to hold or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed.

(c) Trusteeship or receivership over licensee
The Administration shall have authority to act as trustee or receiver of the licensee. Upon request by the Administration, the court may appoint the Administration to act in such capacity unless the court deems such appointment inequitable or otherwise inappropriate by reason of the special circumstances involved.

§687d. Conflicts of interest
For the purpose of controlling conflicts of interest which may be detrimental to small business concerns, to small business investment companies, to the shareholders or partners of either, or to the purposes of this chapter, the Administration shall adopt regulations to govern transactions with any officer, director, shareholder, or partner of any small business investment company, or with any person or concern, in which any interest, direct or indirect, financial or otherwise, is held by any officer, director, shareholder or partner of (1) any small business investment company, or (2) any person or concern with an interest, direct or indirect, financial or otherwise, in any small business investment company. Such regulations shall include appropriate requirements for public disclosure (including disclosure in the locality most directly affected by the transaction) necessary to the purposes of this section.

§687e. Removal and suspension of directors and officers of licensees

(a) Written notice of intention to remove; grounds
The Administration may serve upon any director or officer of a licensee a written notice of its intention to remove him from office whenever, in the opinion of the Administration, such director or officer—
(1) has willfully and knowingly committed any substantial violation of—
(A) this chapter,
(B) any regulation issued under this chapter, or
(C) a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or
(2) has willfully and knowingly committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice which constitutes a substantial breach of his fiduciary duty as such director or officer,
and that such violation or such breach of fiduciary duty is one involving personal dishonesty on the part of such director or officer.

(b) Suspension pending completion of administrative proceedings
In respect to any director or officer referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Administration may, if it deems it necessary for the protection of the licensee or the interests of the Administration, by written notice to such effect served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall become effective upon service of such notice and, unless stayed by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served under subsection (a) of this section and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or, if an order of removal and/or prohibition is issued against the director or officer, until the effective date of any such order. Copies of any such notice shall also be served upon the interested licensee.

(c) Hearing; order of removal
A notice of intention to remove a director or officer, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds therefor, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Administration at the request of (1) such director or officer and for good cause shown, or (2) the Attorney General of the United States. Unless such director or officer shall appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of such removal. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Administration shall find that any of the grounds specified in such notice has been established, the Administration may issue such orders of removal from office as it deems appropriate. Any such order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after service upon such licensee and the director or officer concerned (except in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein). Such order shall remain effective and enforcible except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Administration or a reviewing court.

(d) Stay by United States district court of suspension or prohibition
Within ten days after any director or officer has been suspended from office and/or prohibited from participation in the conduct of the affairs of a licensee under subsection (b) of this section, such director or officer may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the licensee is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for a stay of such suspension and/or prohibition pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served upon such director or officer under subsection (a) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to stay such suspension and/or prohibition.

(e) Suspension of directors and officers charged with felonies involving dishonesty or breach of trust; notice; duration of suspension; removal
Whenever any director or officer of a licensee is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the Administration may, by written notice served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Administration. In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such offense is entered against such director or officer, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Administration may issue and serve upon such director or officer an order removing him from office. A copy of such order shall be served upon such licensee, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such licensee. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to suspend or remove such director or officer from office and/or to prohibit him from further participation in licensee affairs, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section.

(f) Hearings; procedure; form and requisites of decision; review; stay of orders
(1) Any hearing provided for in this section shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the principal office of the licensee is located unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, the Administration shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and cause to be served upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.
(2) Any party to such proceeding may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the director or officer concerned, or an order issued under subsection (e) of this section), by filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the licensee is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Administration be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Administration, and thereupon the Administration shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall, except as provided in the last sentence of said paragraph (1), be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Administration. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
(3) The commencement of proceedings for judicial review under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Administration.

§687f. Unlawful acts and omissions by officers, directors, employees, or agents

(a) Violation by licensee deemed violation by persons participating
Wherever a licensee violates any provision of this chapter or regulation issued thereunder by reason of its failure to comply with the terms thereof or by reason of its engaging in any act or practice which constitutes or will constitute a violation thereof, such violation shall be deemed to be also a violation and an unlawful act on the part of any person who, directly or indirectly, authorizes, orders, participates in, or causes, brings about, counsels, aids, or abets in the commission of any acts, practices, or transactions which constitute or will constitute, in whole or in part, such violation.

(b) Breach of fiduciary duty
It shall be unlawful for any officer, director, employee, agent, or other participant in the management or conduct of the affairs of a licensee to engage in any act or practice, or to omit any act, in breach of his fiduciary duty as such officer, director, employee, agent, or participant, if, as a result thereof, the licensee has suffered or is in imminent danger of suffering financial loss or other damage.

(A) he has been convicted of a felony, or any other criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or

(3) that any guarantor of the lease will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and
