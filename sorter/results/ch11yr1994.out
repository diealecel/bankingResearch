(C) makes such home mortgage loans as, in the judgment of the Board, are long-term loans (except that in the case of a savings bank, this subparagraph applies only if, in the judgment of the Board, its time deposits, as defined in section 461 of this title, warrant its making such loans).

(2) Qualified thrift lender
An insured depository institution that is not a member on January 1, 1989, may become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank only if—
(A) the insured depository institution has at least 10 percent of its total assets in residential mortgage loans;

(C) the character of its management and its home-financing policy are consistent with sound and economical home financing.

(b) Location requirement
An institution eligible to become a member under this section may become a member only of, or secure advances from, the Federal Home Loan Bank of the district in which is located the institution's principal place of business, or of the bank of a district adjoining such district, if demanded by convenience and then only with the approval of the Board.

(c) Inspection and regulation requirements
Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (2) of subsection (a) of this section requiring inspection and regulation under law as a condition with respect to eligibility for membership, any building and loan association which would be eligible to become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank except for the fact that it is not subject to inspection and regulation under the banking laws or similar laws of the State in which such association is organized shall, upon subjecting itself to such inspection and regulation as the Board shall prescribe, be eligible to become a member.

(b) Minimum subscriptions; retirement of oversubscriptions; limitations; cancellation of oversubscriptions; aggregate unpaid loan principal; reports and information
(1) The original stock subscription of each institution eligible to become a member under section 1424 of this title shall be an amount equal to 1 per centum of the subscriber's aggregate unpaid loan principal, but not less than $500. The bank shall annually, as of the close of the calendar year, adjust, at such time and in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may by regulations or otherwise prescribe, the amount of stock held by each member so that such member shall have invested in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank at least an amount calculated in the manner provided in the next preceding sentence (but not less than $500). If the bank finds that the investment of any member in stock is greater than that required under this subsection it may, unless prohibited by said Board or by the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, in its discretion and upon application of such member retire the stock of such member in excess of the amount so required. Said Board, in its discretion, may, by regulations or otherwise, provide for adjustments in amounts of stock to be issued or retired in order that stock may be issued or retired only in entire shares.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, no action shall be taken by any bank with respect to any member pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this subsection if the effect of such action would be to cause the aggregate outstanding advances, within the meaning of the last sentence of subsection (c) of section 1430 of this title or within the meaning of regulations of the Board defining such term for the purposes of this sentence, made by such bank to such member to exceed twenty times the amounts paid in by such member for outstanding capital stock held by such member.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (i) 1 of this section, upon retirement of stock of any member the bank shall pay such member for the stock retired an amount equal to the par value of such stock, or, at the election of the bank, the whole or any part of the payment which would otherwise be so made shall be credited upon the indebtedness of the member to the bank. In either such event, stock equal in par value to the amount of the payment or credit, or both, as the case may be, shall be canceled.
(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "aggregate unpaid loan principal" means the aggregate unpaid principal of a subscriber's or member's home mortgage loans, home-purchase contracts, and similar obligations.
(5) The Board, by regulations or otherwise, may require each member to submit such reports and information as said Board, in its discretion, may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this subsection.

(c) Payments for stock
Stock subscriptions other than by the United States shall be paid for in cash, and shall be paid for at the time of application therefor, or, at the election of the subscriber, in installments, but not less than one-fourth of the total amount payable shall be paid at the time of filing application, and a further sum of not less than one-fourth of such total shall have been paid at the end of each succeeding period of four months.

(d) Transfer or hypothecation of stock
Stock subscribed for otherwise than by the United States, and the right to the proceeds thereof, shall not be transferred or hypothecated except as hereinafter provided and the certificates therefor shall so state.

(e) Withdrawal or removal of members; surrender and cancellation of stock; prepayment penalties
Any member other than a Federal savings and loan association may withdraw from membership in a Federal Home Loan Bank six months after filing with the Board written notice of intention so to do, and the Board may, after hearing, remove any member from membership, if, in the opinion of the Board, such member (i) has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter or regulation of the Board made pursuant thereto; (ii) is insolvent: Provided, That any member of a bank which is a building and loan association, savings and loan association, cooperative bank, or homestead association shall be deemed insolvent if the assets of such member are less than its obligations to its creditors and others, including the holders of its withdrawable accounts; or (iii) has a management or home-financing policy of a character inconsistent with sound and economical home financing or with the purposes of this chapter. If any member's membership in a Federal Home Loan Bank is terminated, the indebtedness of such member to the Federal Home Loan Bank shall be liquidated in an orderly manner (as determined by the Federal Home Loan Bank), and upon completion of such liquidation, the capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank owned by such member shall be surrendered and canceled. Any such liquidation shall be deemed a prepayment of any such indebtedness, and shall be subject to any penalties or other fees applicable to such prepayment. Upon the liquidation of such indebtedness such member shall be entitled to the return of its collateral, and, upon surrender and cancellation of such capital stock, the member shall receive a sum equal to its cash paid subscriptions for the capital stock surrendered, except that if at any time the Board finds that the paid-in capital of a Federal Home Loan Bank is or is likely to be impaired as a result of losses in or depreciation of the assets held, the Federal Home Loan Bank shall on the order of the Board withhold from the amount to be paid in retirement of the stock a pro rata share of the amount of such impairment as determined by the Board.

(f) Disposal of stock
A Federal Home Loan Bank may, with the approval of the Board, permit the disposal of stock to another member, or to an institution eligible to become a member, but only to enable such an institution to become a member.

(g) Dividends
All stock of any Federal Home Loan Bank shall share in dividend distributions without preference.

(h) Acquisition of membership after expiration of period of withdrawal
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an institution which withdraws from membership may acquire membership in any Federal Home Loan Bank only after the expiration of a period of 10 years thereafter, except where such withdrawal is a consequence of a transfer of membership on a non-interrupted basis between banks or in connection with obtaining a charter as a Federal savings association (as defined in section 1813 of this title).

§1427. Directors

(a) Number; appointment and election; qualifications; conflicts of interest
The management of each Federal home loan bank shall be vested in a board of fourteen directors, eight of whom shall be elected by the members as hereinafter provided in this section and six of whom shall be appointed by the Board referred to in section 1422a of this title, all of whom shall be citizens of the United States and bona fide residents of the district in which such bank is located: Provided, That in any district which includes five or more States the Board may by regulation increase the elective directors to a number not exceeding thirteen and may increase the appointive directors to a number not exceeding three-fourths the number of elective directors: Provided further, That if at any time the number of elective directors in the case of any district is not at least equal to the number of States in such district the Board shall exercise the authority conferred by the next preceding proviso so as to increase such elective directors to a number at least equal to the number of States in such district. At least 2 of the Federal Home Loan Bank directors who are appointed by the Board shall be representatives chosen from organizations with more than a 2-year history of representing consumer or community interests on banking services, credit needs, housing, or financial consumer protections. No Federal Home Loan Bank director who is appointed pursuant to this subsection may, during such Bank director's term of office, serve as an officer of any Federal Home Loan Bank or a director or officer of any member of a Bank, or hold shares, or any other financial interest in, any member of a Bank.

(b) Elective directorships; qualifications; nominations and election
Each elective directorship shall be designated by the Board as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined. No person who is an officer or director of a member that fails to meet any applicable capital requirement is eligible to hold the office of Federal Home Loan Bank director. As used in this subsection and in subsection (c) of this section, the term "member" means a member of a Federal home loan bank which was a member of such bank at the end of such calendar year.

(c) Apportionment among States in bank district; designation of State location
The number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in each separate State in a bank district shall be determined by the Board in the approximate ratio of the percentage of the required stock, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, of the members located in that State at the end of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election to the total required stock, as so determined, of all members of such bank at the end of such year, except that in the case of each State such number shall not be less than one and shall not be more than six. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if at any time the number of elective directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Board shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of elective directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number. Any elective directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Board shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Board to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located. As used in the second sentence of this subsection, the term "total number of elective directorships" means the total number of elective directorships on the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State was located on December 31, 1960, and the term "members" where used for the second time in such sentence means members of such bank.

(d) Terms; rules and regulations governing nominations and elections
The term of each elective directorship shall be two years and the term of each appointive directorship shall be four years. If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as an elective director of a Federal home loan bank in any elective directorship or elective directorships and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to an elective directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.

(e) Continuation of existing terms; directorship for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
Each term, outstanding on the effective date of the amendment to this section abolishing the division of elective directors into classes, of an elective or appointive directorship then existing shall continue until its original date of expiration, and any elective or appointive directorship in existence on said date shall continue to exist to the same extent as if it had been established by or under this section on or after said date. The Board in its discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment. The term "States" or "State" as used in this section shall mean the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Board, by regulation or otherwise, may add an additional elective directorship to the board of directors of the bank of any district in which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is included at the time such directorship is added and which does not then include five or more States, may fix the commencement and the duration, which shall not exceed two years, of the initial term of any directorship so added, and may fill any such initial term by appointment: Provided, That (1) any directorship added pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be designated by the Board, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as representing the members located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, (2) such designation of such directorship shall not be changed, and (3) such directorship shall automatically cease to exist if and when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ceases to be included in such district.

(f) Vacancies

(1) In general
A Bank director appointed or elected to fill a vacancy shall be appointed or elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office.

(2) Appointed Bank directors
In the event of a vacancy in any appointive Bank directorship, such vacancy shall be filled through appointment by the Board for the unexpired term. If any appointive Bank director shall cease to have the qualifications set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the office held by such person shall immediately become vacant, but such person may continue to act as a Bank director until his or her successor assumes the vacated office or the term of such office expires, whichever occurs first.

(3) Elected Bank directors
In the event of a vacancy in any elective Bank directorship, such vacancy shall be filled by an affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Bank directors, regardless of whether such remaining Bank directors constitute a quorum of the Bank's board of directors. A Bank director so elected shall satisfy the requirements for eligibility which were applicable to his predecessor. If any elective Bank director shall cease to have any qualification set forth in this section, the office held by such person shall immediately become vacant, and such person shall not continue to act as a Bank director.

(g) Chairman and vice chairman
The Board shall designate one of the directors of each bank to be chairman, and one to be vice chairman, of the board of directors of such bank.

(h) Appointment where members hold less than $1,000,000 of capital stock
If at any time when nominations are required members shall hold less than $1,000,000 of the capital stock of the Federal home loan bank, the Board shall appoint a director or directors to fill the place or places for which such nominations are required, and the Board may, prior to the filing of the certificate mentioned in section 1432 of this title, appoint directors who shall be respectively designated by it as appointive directors and as elective directors, in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(i) Compensation and expenses of director
Each bank may pay its directors reasonable compensation for the time required of them, and their necessary expenses, in the performance of their duties, in accordance with the resolutions adopted by such directors, subject to the approval of the board.

(j) Duties of directors
Such board of directors shall administer the affairs of the bank fairly and impartially and without discrimination in favor of or against any member, and shall, subject to the provisions hereof, extend to each institution authorized to secure advances such advances as may be made safely and reasonably with due regard for the claims and demands of other institutions, and with due regard to the maintenance of adequate credit standing for the Federal Home Loan Bank and its obligations.

(k) Indemnification of directors, officers, and employees
The board of directors of each Bank shall determine the terms and conditions under which such Bank may indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents.

§1428. Examination of State laws, regulations, and procedures; studies of values, etc.
The Board shall cause to be made from time to time examinations of the laws of the various States of the United States and the regulations and procedure thereunder governing conditions under which institutions of the kinds which may become members or nonmember borrowers under this chapter are permitted to be formed or to do business, or relating to the conveying or recording of land titles, or to homestead and other rights, or to the enforcement of the rights of holders of mortgages on lands securing loans, or otherwise. If any such examination shall indicate, in the opinion of the Board, that under the laws of any such State or the regulations or procedure thereunder there would be inadequate protection to a Federal Home Loan Bank in making or collecting advances under this chapter, the Board may withhold or limit the operation of any Federal Home Loan Bank in such State until satisfactory conditions of law, regulation, or procedure shall be established. In any State where State examination of members or nonmember borrowers is deemed inadequate for the purposes of the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Board shall establish such examination, all or part of the cost of which may be considered as part of the cost of making advances in such State. The banks and/or the Board may make studies of trends of home and other property values, methods of appraisals, and other subjects such as they may deem useful for the general guidance of their policies and operations and those of institutions authorized to secure advances.

§1428a. Repealed. Pub. L. 101–73, title VII, §718, Aug. 9, 1989, 103 Stat. 422

§1429. Eligibility to secure advances
Any member of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall be entitled to apply in writing for advances. Such application shall be in such form as shall be required by the Federal Home Loan Bank with the approval of the Board. Such Federal Home Loan Bank may at its discretion deny any such application, or, subject to the approval of the Board, may grant it on such conditions as the Federal Home Loan Bank may prescribe.

§1430. Advances

(a) Authorization to make secured advances
Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make secured advances to its members upon collateral sufficient, in the judgment of the Bank, to fully secure advances obtained from the Bank under this section or section 1431(g) of this title. All long-term advances shall only be made for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance. A Bank, at the time of origination or renewal of a loan or advance, shall obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral eligible pursuant to one or more of the following categories:
(1) Fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property (not more than 90 days delinquent), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages.
(2) Securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the United States Government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association).
(3) Deposits of a Federal Home Loan Bank.
(4) Other real estate related collateral acceptable to the Bank if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and the Bank can perfect its interest in the collateral. The aggregate amount of outstanding advances secured by such other real estate related collateral shall not exceed 30 percent of such member's capital.
(5) Paragraphs (1) through (4) shall not affect the ability of any Federal Home Loan Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its security position with respect to outstanding advances, including requiring deposits of additional collateral security, whether or not such additional security would be eligible to originate an advance. If an advance existing on August 9, 1989, matures and the member does not have sufficient eligible collateral to fully secure a renewal of such advance, a Bank may renew such advance secured by such collateral as the Bank and the Board determines is appropriate. A member that has an advance secured by such insufficient eligible collateral must reduce its level of outstanding advances promptly and prudently in accordance with a schedule determined by the Board.

(b) Appraisals and other investigations; acceptance of home mortgages as collateral security only by formal Board resolution
For the purposes of this section, each Home Loan Bank shall have power to make, or to cause or require to be made, such appraisals and other investigations as it may deem necessary. No home mortgage otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral security for an advance by a Home Loan Bank shall be accepted if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the Home Loan Bank or of the borrowing institution is personally liable thereon, unless the Board has specifically approved by formal resolution such acceptance.
