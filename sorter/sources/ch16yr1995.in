<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application to Corporation required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), any depository institution which is engaged in the business of receiving deposits other than trust funds (as defined in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="1995" section="1813" title="12">section 1813(p) of this title</uscode>), upon application to and examination by the Corporation and approval by the Board of Directors, may become an insured depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interim depository institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any interim Federal depository institution that is chartered by the appropriate Federal banking agency and will not open for business, the depository institution shall be an insured depository institution upon the issuance of the institution's charter by the agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application and approval not required in cases of continued insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of any depository institution whose insured status is continued pursuant to <uscode edition="1995" section="1814" title="12">section 1814 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In reviewing any application under this subsection, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors described in <uscode edition="1995" section="1816" title="12">section 1816 of this title</uscode> in determining whether to approve the application for insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of denial of application for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board of Directors votes to deny any application for insurance by any depository institution, the Board of Directors shall promptly notify the appropriate Federal banking agency and, in the case of any State depository institution, the appropriate State banking supervisor of the denial of such application, giving specific reasons in writing for the Board of Directors’ determination with reference to the factors described in <uscode edition="1995" section="1816" title="12">section 1816 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nondelegation requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of the Board of Directors to make any determination to deny any application under this subsection may not be delegated by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreign branch nonmember banks; matters considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this chapter and to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may impose, any branch of a foreign bank, upon application by the bank to the Corporation, and examination by the Corporation of the branch, and approval by the Board of Directors, may become an insured branch. Before approving any such application, the Board of Directors shall give consideration to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial history and condition of the bank,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the adequacy of its capital structure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) its future earnings prospects,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the general character and fitness of its management, including but not limited to the management of the branch proposed to be insured,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the risk presented to the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the convenience and needs of the community to be served by the branch,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether or not its corporate powers, insofar as they will be exercised through the proposed insured branch, are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the probable adequacy and reliability of information supplied and to be supplied by the bank to the Corporation to enable it to carry out its functions under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection to deposit insurance fund; surety bond, pledge of assets, etc.; injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall deliver to the Corporation or as the Corporation may direct a surety bond, a pledge of assets, or both, in such amounts and of such types as the Corporation may require or approve, for the purpose set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall maintain on deposit with the Corporation, or as the Corporation may direct, surety bonds or assets or both, in such amounts and of such types as shall be determined from time to time in accordance with such regulations as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Such regulations may impose differing requirements on the basis of any factors which in the judgment of the Board of Directors <!-- PDFPage:893 -->are reasonably related to the purpose set forth in paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Corporation may require of any given bank larger deposits of bonds and assets than required under paragraph (2) of this subsection if, in the judgment of the Corporation, the situation of that bank or any branch thereof is or becomes such that the deposits of bonds and assets otherwise required under this section would not adequately fulfill the purpose set forth in paragraph (4). The imposition of any such additional requirements may be without notice or opportunity for hearing, but the Corporation shall afford an opportunity to any such bank to apply for a reduction or removal of any such additional requirements so imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The purpose of the surety bonds and pledges of assets required under this subsection is to provide protection to the deposit insurance fund against the risks entailed in insuring the domestic deposits of a foreign bank whose activities, assets, and personnel are in large part outside the jurisdiction of the United States. In the implementation of its authority under this subsection, however, the Corporation shall endeavor to avoid imposing requirements on such banks which would unnecessarily place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestically incorporated banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any failure or threatened failure of a foreign bank to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection (c), the Corporation, in addition to all other administrative and judicial remedies, may apply to any United States district court, or United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which any branch of the bank is located, for an injunction to compel such bank and any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or any other person having custody or control of any of its assets, to deliver to the Corporation such assets as may be necessary to meet such requirement, and to take any other action necessary to vest the Corporation with control of assets so delivered. If the court shall determine that there has been any such failure or threatened failure to comply with any such requirement, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction. The propriety of the requirement may be litigated only as provided in <uscode chapter="7" edition="1995" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>, and may not be made an issue in an action for an injunction under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Uninsured institutions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any institution that becomes insured by the Corporation, and any noninsured branch that becomes insured by the Corporation, shall pay the Corporation any fee which the Corporation may by regulation prescribe, after giving due consideration to the need to establish and maintain reserve ratios in the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund as required by <uscode edition="1995" section="1817" title="12">section 1817 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fee credited to appropriate fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The fee paid by the depository institution shall be credited to the Bank Insurance Fund if the depository institution becomes a Bank Insurance Fund member, and to the Savings Association Insurance Fund if the depository institution becomes a Savings Association Insurance Fund member.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception for certain depository institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any depository institution that becomes an insured depository institution by operation of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1995" section="1814" title="12">section 1814(a) of this title</uscode> shall not pay any fee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conversions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Prior approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No insured depository institution may participate in a conversion transaction without the prior approval of the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) 5-year moratorium on conversions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Corporation may not approve any conversion transaction before the later of the end of the 5-year period beginning on August 9, 1989, or the date on which the Savings Association Insurance Fund first meets or exceeds the designated reserve ratio for such fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) “Conversion transaction” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term “conversion transaction” means—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) from a Bank Insurance Fund member to a Savings Association Insurance Fund member; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) from a Savings Association Insurance Fund member to a Bank Insurance Fund member;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Approval during moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may approve a conversion transaction at any time if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the conversion transaction affects an insubstantial portion, as determined by the Corporation, of the total deposits of each depository institution participating in the conversion transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the conversion occurs in connection with the acquisition of a Savings Association Insurance Fund member in default or in danger of default, and the Corporation determines that the estimated financial benefits to the Savings Association Insurance Fund or Resolution Trust Corporation equal or exceed the Corporation's estimate of loss of assessment income to such insurance fund over the remaining balance of the moratorium period established by subparagraph (A), and the Resolution Trust Corporation concurs in the Corporation's determination; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the conversion occurs in connection with the acquisition of a Bank Insurance Fund member in default or in danger of default and the Corporation determines that the estimated financial benefits to the Bank Insurance Fund equal or exceed the Corporation's estimate of the loss of assessment income to the insurance fund over the remaining balance of the moratorium period established by subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Certain transfers deemed to affect insubstantial portion of total deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (C)(i), any conversion transaction shall be deemed to affect an insubstantial portion of the total deposits of an insured depository institution, to the extent the aggregate amount of the total deposits transferred in such transaction and in all conversion transactions occurring after August 9, 1989, does not exceed 35 percent of the lesser of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount which is equal to the sum of—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the total amount of net interest credited to the depository institution's deposits during the period beginning on May 1, 1989, and ending on the date of the transfer of deposits in connection with such transaction; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a conversion transaction in which the resulting or acquiring depository institution is not a Savings Association Insurance Fund member, an exit fee (in an amount to be determined and assessed in accordance with subparagraph (F)) which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) shall be deposited in the Savings Association Insurance Fund; or</p>

Such bank shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any such bank which fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any such bank knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Corporation may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such bank, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Corporation in the manner provided in subparagraphs (E), (F), (G), and (I) of <uscode detail="(i)(2)" edition="1995" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(i)(2) of this title</uscode> (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section.

The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution's own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the <!-- PDFPage:902 -->loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The deposits to be reported on such reports of condition shall be segregated between (i) time and savings deposits and (ii) demand deposits.

<p class="statutory-body">(10) A Federal banking agency may not, by regulation or otherwise, designate, or require an insured institution or an affiliate to designate, a corporation as highly leveraged or a transaction with a corporation as a highly leveraged transaction solely because such corporation is or has been a debtor or bankrupt under title 11, if, after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, such corporation would not otherwise be highly leveraged.</p>

No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such depository institution made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the depository institution shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not so insured. Such depository institution shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured depository institution for the period referred to in the 1st sentence from the date of such termination, and in the event that such depository institution shall be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors within such period, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such depository institution as in case of an insured depository institution.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recognition of claimant not on depository institution records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, neither the Corporation nor such new bank or other insured depository institution shall be required to recognize as the owner of any portion of a deposit appearing on the records of the depository institution in default under a name other than that of the claimant, any person whose name or interest as such owner is not disclosed on the records of such depository institution in default as part owner of said deposit, if such recognition would increase the aggregate amount of the insured deposits in such depository institution in default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding payments to meet liability to depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor in a depository institution in default as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor to the depository institution in default or its receiver, which is not offset against a claim due from such depository institution, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of United States deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the deposit is a United States deposit it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a banking agency shall not be required to file a report requested by the responsible agency under this paragraph if such banking agency advises the responsible agency by the applicable date under the preceding sentence that the report is not necessary because none of the effects described in paragraph (5) are likely to occur as a result of the transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon the consummation of a merger transaction in compliance with this subsection and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this paragraph, or upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="1995" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>, but nothing in this subsection shall exempt any bank or savings association resulting from a merger transaction from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction approved by a Federal supervisory agency pursuant to this subsection, such agency, and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved, may appear as a part of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel.</p>

The responsible agency may by rule, regulation, or otherwise and under such civil penalties (which shall be cumulative to any other remedies) as it may prescribe take whatever action it deems necessary or appropriate to implement or enforce this subsection.</p>

The Congress further finds that microfilm or other reproductions and other records made by banks <sup><a href="#1829b_1_target" name="1829b_1">1</a></sup> of checks, as well as records kept by banks <sup><a href="#1829b_1_target" name="1829b_1">1</a></sup> of the identity of persons maintaining or authorized to act with respect to accounts therein, have been of particular value in this respect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is the purpose of this section to require the maintenance of appropriate types of records by insured depository institutions in the United States where such records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recordkeeping regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) determines that the maintenance of appropriate types of records and other evidence by insured depository institutions has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Domestic funds transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Board”) determine that the maintenance of records, by insured depository institutions, of payment orders which direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, the Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section with respect to the maintenance of such records.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a microfilm or other reproduction of each check, draft, or similar instrument drawn on it and presented to it for payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a record of each check, draft, or similar instrument received by it for deposit or collec<!-- PDFPage:1018 -->tion, together with an identification of the party for whose account it is to be deposited or collected, unless the insured depository institution has already made a record of the party's identity pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identity of persons making reportable currency and foreign transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section, whenever any individual engages (whether as principal, agent, or bailee) in any transaction with an insured depository institution which is required to be reported or recorded under subchapter II of <uscode chapter="53" edition="1995" title="31">chapter 53 of title 31</uscode>, the insured depository institution shall require and retain such evidence of the identity of that individual as the Secretary may prescribe as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide homeownership and rental housing opportunities for very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding and limitations of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Duration of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this section shall be effective, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), only during the 3-year period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual fiscal limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the provisions of this section shall apply only—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent that amounts are provided in appropriations Acts pursuant to subparagraph (C) for any other costs relating to the program under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition of losses</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Affordable housing discount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term “affordable housing discount” means, with respect to any eligible residential or eligible condominium property transferred under this section by the Corporation, the difference (if any) between the realizable disposition value of the property and the actual sale price of the property under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term “realizable disposition value” means the estimated sale price that the Corporation reasonably would be able to obtain upon the sale of a property by the Corporation under the provisions of this chapter, not including this section, and any other applicable laws. Not later than the expiration of the 120-day period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), the Corporation shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, procedures for determining the realizable disposition value of a property transferred under this section, which shall take into consideration such factors as the Corporation considers appropriate, including the actual sale prices of properties disposed of by the Resolution Trust Corporation under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1995" section="1441a" title="12">section 1441a(c) of this title</uscode>, the prices of other properties sold under similar programs, and the appraised value of the property transferred under this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this section shall not apply to any eligible residential property or any eligible condominium property that is subject to an agreement entered into by the Corporation before the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) that provides for any other disposition of the property.</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The restrictions described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument.

The Corporation shall actively market eligible single family properties for sale to low-income families and to low-income families with members who are veterans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recapture of profits from resale</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other recapture provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement under paragraph (3) shall not apply to any eligible single family property for which, upon resale by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, a portion of the sale proceeds or any subsidy provided in connection with the acquisition of the property by the household or family is required to be recaptured or repaid under any other Federal, State, or local law (including <uscode detail="(m)" edition="1995" section="143" title="26">section 143(m) of title 26</uscode>) or regulation or under any sale agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (2), during the 180-day period following the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation may sell the property to the household residing in the property, but only if (A) such household was residing in the property at the time notice regarding the property was provided to clearinghouses under paragraph (1), (B) such sale is necessary to avoid the displacement of, and unnecessary hardship to, the resident household, (C) the resident household intends to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months, and (D) the resident household certifies in writing that the household intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice of readiness for sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2) for a property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to any qualifying multifamily purchaser that has expressed serious interest in the property.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose offer is accepted during the 45-day period to purchase the property before the expiration of the period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">No purchaser of an eligible multifamily property may terminate the occupancy of any person residing in the property on the date of purchase for purposes of meeting the low-income occupancy requirement applicable to the property under paragraph (7).

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a merger transaction may not be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) if the transaction involves a bank the home State of which has enacted a law after September 29, 1994, and before June 1, 1997, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A merger transaction may be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) before June 1, 1997, if the home State of each bank involved in the transaction has in effect, as of the date of the approval of such transaction, a law that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1064 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) expressly permits interstate merger transactions with all out-of-State banks.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain conditions allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A host State may impose conditions on a branch within such State of a bank resulting from an interstate merger transaction if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the imposition of the conditions is not preempted by Federal law; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An interstate merger transaction may involve the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank only if the law of the State in which the branch is located permits out-of-State banks to acquire a branch of a bank in such State without acquiring the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of branch for purposes of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an interstate merger transaction which involves the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank, the branch shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an insured bank the home State of which is the State in which the branch is located.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Preservation of State age laws</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1) that would have the effect of permitting an out-of-State bank or out-of-State bank holding company to acquire a bank in a host State that has not been in existence for the minimum period of time, if any, specified in the statutory law of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for State age laws specifying a period of more than 5 years</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) comply with the filing requirements of any host State of the bank which will result from such transaction to the extent that the requirement—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks or out-of-State bank holding companies or subsidiaries of such banks or bank holding companies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is similar in effect to any requirement imposed by the host State on a nonbanking corporation incorporated in another State that engages in business in the host State; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the authority of any State to limit, by statute, regulation, or order, the percentage of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the State which may be held or controlled by any bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank <!-- PDFPage:1065 -->holding company) to the extent the application of such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Exceptions to subparagraph (B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section without regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with respect to any State if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transaction is approved by the appropriate State bank supervisor of such State and the standard on which such approval is based does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comply with the responsibilities of the agency regarding such application under <uscode edition="1995" section="2903" title="12">section 2903 of this title</uscode>;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Surrender of charter after merger transaction</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Imposition of shares tax by host States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a branch of an out-of-State bank which results from an interstate merger transaction, a proportionate amount of the value of the shares of the out-of-State bank may be subject to any bank shares tax levied or imposed by the host State, or any political subdivision of such host State that imposes such tax based upon a method adopted by the host State, which may include allocation and apportionment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall prescribe uniform regulations effective June 1, 1997, which prohibit any out-of-State bank from using any authority to engage in interstate branching pursuant to this title,<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law, primarily for the purpose of deposit production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines for meeting credit needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations issued under subsection (a) of this section shall include guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-State bank in a host State are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities which the branches serve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on out-of-State loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Regulations issued under subsection (a) of this section shall require that, beginning no earlier than 1 year after establishment or acquisition of an interstate branch or branches in a host State by an out-of-State bank, if the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank determines that the bank's level of lending in the host State relative to the deposits from the host State (as reasonably determinable from available information including the agency's sampling of the bank's loan files during an examination or such data as is otherwise available) is less than half the average of total loans in the host State relative to total deposits from the host State (as determinable from relevant sources) for all banks the home State of which is such State—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank shall review the loan portfolio of the bank and determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the agency determines that the out-of-State bank is not reasonably helping to meet those needs—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agency may order that an interstate branch or branches of such bank in the host State be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal bank<!-- PDFPage:1079 -->ing agency that the bank has an acceptable plan that will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the out-of-State bank may not open a new interstate branch in the host State unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the interstate branch was acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the nature of the acquired institution's business or loan portfolio;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank have a higher concentration of commercial or credit card lending, trust services, or other specialized activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the ratings received by the out-of-State bank under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [<uscode edition="1995" section="2901" title="12">12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.</uscode>];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) economic conditions, including the level of loan demand, within the communities served by the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the safe and sound operation and condition of the out-of-State bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Branch closing procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before exercising any authority under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall issue to the bank a notice of the agency's intention to close an interstate branch or branches and shall schedule a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><uscode detail="(h)" edition="1995" section="1818" title="12">Section 1818(h) of this title</uscode> shall apply to any proceeding brought under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply with respect to any interstate branch established or acquired in a host State pursuant to this title <sup><a href="#1835a_2_target" name="1835a_2">2</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title <sup><a href="#1835a_2_target" name="1835a_2">2</a></sup> to any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
