<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Informed use of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms of personal property leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation, contents, etc., of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Except with respect to the provisions of <uscode edition="2012" section="1639" title="15">section 1639 of this title</uscode> that apply to a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) <sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> of this title, such regulations may contain such additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Model disclosure forms and clauses; publication, criteria, compliance, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall publish a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions (including real estate settlement cost statements) which includes the disclosure requirements of this subchapter in conjunction with the disclosure requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [<uscode edition="2012" section="2601" title="12">12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.</uscode>] that, taken together, may apply to a transaction that is subject to both or either provisions of law. The purpose of such model disclosure shall be to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of this subchapter and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, and to aid the borrower or lessee in understanding the transaction by utilizing readily understandable language to simplify the technical nature of the disclosures. In devising such forms, the Bureau shall consider the use by creditors or lessors of data processing or similar automated equipment. Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Bureau under this section. A creditor or lessor shall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure provisions of this subchapter with respect to other than numerical disclosures if the creditor or lessor (1) uses any appropriate model form or clause as published by the Bureau, or (2) uses any such model form or clause and changes it by (A) deleting any information which is not required by this subchapter, or (B) rearranging the format, if in making such deletion or rearranging the format, the creditor or lessor does not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures applicable for adoption of model forms and clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Model disclosure forms and clauses shall be adopted by the Bureau after notice duly given in the Federal Register and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with <uscode edition="2012" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective dates of regulations containing new disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any regulation of the Bureau, or any amendment or interpretation thereof, requiring any disclosure which differs from the disclosures previously required by this part, part D, or part E of this subchapter or by any regulation of the Bureau promulgated thereunder shall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation, except that the Bureau may at its discretion take interim action by regulation, amendment, or interpretation to lengthen the period of time permitted for creditors or lessors to adjust their forms to accommodate new requirements or shorten the length of time for creditors or lessors to make such adjustments when it makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent unfair or deceptive disclosure practices. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, any creditor or lessor may comply with any such newly promulgated disclosure requirements prior to the effective date of the requirements.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) <sup><a href="#1604_2_target" name="1604_2">2</a></sup> Exemption authority</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may exempt, by regulation, from all or part of this subchapter all or any class of transactions, other than transactions involving any mortgage described in section 1602(aa) <sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> of this title, for which, in the determination of the Bureau, coverage under all or part of this subchapter does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining which classes of transactions to exempt in whole or in part under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider the following factors and publish its rationale at the time a proposed exemption is published for comment:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The amount of the loan and whether the disclosures, right of rescission, and other provisions provide a benefit to the consumers who are parties to such transactions, as determined by the Bureau.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The extent to which the requirements of this subchapter complicate, hinder, or make more expensive the credit process for the class of transactions.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The status of the borrower, including—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_C_i"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_f_2_C_ii"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_f_2_C_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under this subchapter, as determined by the Bureau;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the consumer; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the goal of consumer protection would be undermined by such an exemption.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Waiver for certain borrowers</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau, by regulation, may exempt from the requirements of this subchapter certain credit transactions if—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction involves a consumer—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1_A_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with an annual earned income of more than $200,000; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) having net assets in excess of $1,000,000 at the time of the transaction; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a waiver that is handwritten, signed, and dated by the consumer is first obtained from the consumer.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments by the Bureau</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau, at its discretion, may adjust the annual earned income and net asset requirements of paragraph (1) for inflation.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any power granted to any Federal agency under this subchapter, the deference that a court affords to the Bureau with respect to a determination made by the Bureau relating to the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this subchapter, other than <uscode edition="2012" range="1639e or 1639h" section="1639e" title="15">section 1639e or 1639h of this title</uscode>, shall be applied as if the Bureau were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Authority of the Board to prescribe rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Board shall have authority to prescribe rules under this subchapter with respect to a person described in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2012" section="5519" title="12">section 5519(a) of title 12</uscode>. Regulations prescribed under this subsection may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the finance charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be determined as the sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. The finance charge shall not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents (including settlement agents, attorneys, and escrow and title companies) if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) "Annual percentage rate" defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annual percentage rate applicable to any extension of consumer credit shall be determined, in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau,</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of rate of finance charges for balances within a specified range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a creditor imposes the same finance charge for balances within a specified range, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on the median balance within the range, except that if the Bureau determines that a rate so computed would not be meaningful, or would be materially misleading, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on such other basis as the Bureau may be regulation require.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowable tolerances for purposes of compliance with disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The disclosure of an annual percentage rate is accurate for the purpose of this subchapter if the rate disclosed is within a tolerance not greater than one-eighth of 1 per centum more or less than the actual rate or rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 per centum. The Bureau may allow a greater tolerance to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of rate tables or charts having allowable variance from determined rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may authorize the use of rate tables or charts which may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which vary from the rate determined in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section by not more than such tolerances as the Bureau may allow. The Bureau may not allow a tolerance greater than 8 per centum of that rate except to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of tolerances in determining annual percentage rates</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out its enforcement activities under this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and is authorized in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, (A) each agency shall apply (i) with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, and (ii) with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate; except that (B) with respect to transactions consummated after two years following March 31, 1980, each agency shall apply (i) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten years or less, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, but in no event a tolerance of less than the tolerances allowed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, (ii) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, and (iii) for all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall require such an adjustment when it determines that such disclosure error resulted from (A) a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, (B) gross negligence, or (C) a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, an agency need not require such an adjustment if it determines that such disclosure error—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving the disclosures described in sections 1605(b), (c) and (d) of this title, in which event the agency may require such remedial action as it determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after two years after March 31, 1980, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2012" section="1605" title="15">section 1605(b) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involved a disclosed amount which was 10 per centum or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of other such disclosure errors, each agency may require such an adjustment.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), no adjustment shall be ordered—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the agency may—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_A_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the agency considers to be reasonable, if (in the case of an agency referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) of this section), the agency determines that a partial adjustment or making partial payments over an extended period is necessary to avoid causing the creditor to become undercapitalized pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode edition="2012" section="1831o" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1831o</uscode>];</p>

<a name="substructure-location_e_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the <sup><a href="#1607_1_target" name="1607_1">1</a></sup> amount of the adjustment would be less than $1, except that if more than one year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the agency may require that such amount be paid into the Treasury of the United States, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_C_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to creditors that are subject to examination by the agencies referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of examination in which such practices were first identified;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_C_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to creditors that are not subject to examination by such agencies, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_C_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in no event after the later of (I) the expiration of the life of the credit extension, or (II) two years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_e_4"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_e_4_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an adjustment under this subsection may be required by an agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section only by an order issued in accordance with cease and desist procedures provided by the provision of law referred to in such subsections.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_4_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In case of an agency which is not authorized to conduct cease and desist proceedings, such an order may be issued after an agency hearing on the record conducted at least thirty but not more than sixty days after notice of the alleged violation is served on the creditor. Such a hearing shall be deemed to be a hearing which is subject to the provisions of section 8(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode detail="(h)" edition="2012" section="1818" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1818(h)</uscode>] and shall be subject to judicial review as provided therein.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any provision of law referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, no agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section may require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under this subchapter, except with regard to the requirements of <uscode edition="2012" section="1666d" title="15">section 1666d of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (e)(1), subsection (e)(3)(C)(i), and subsection (e)(3)(C)(ii) of this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section shall require an adjustment for an annual percentage rate disclosure error that exceeds a tolerance of one quarter of one percent less than the actual rate, determined without regard to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, with respect to any transaction consummated between January 1, 1977, and March 31, 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall determine whether tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate are necessary to facilitate compliance with this subchapter, and if it determines that such tolerances are necessary to facilitate compliance, it shall by regulation permit disclosures within such tolerances. The Bureau shall exercise its authority to permit tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate so that such tolerances are narrow enough to prevent such tolerances from resulting in misleading disclosures or disclosures that circumvent the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1635. Right of rescission as to certain transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of any consumer credit transaction (including opening or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) in which a security interest, including any such interest arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to rescind any transaction subject to this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of money or property following rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modification and waiver of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may, if it finds that such action is necessary in order to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver of any rights created under this section to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exempted transactions; reapplication of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a residential mortgage transaction as defined in section 1602(w) <sup><a href="#1635_1_target" name="1635_1">1</a></sup> of this title;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transaction which constitutes a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a transaction in which an agency of a State is the creditor; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) advances under a preexisting open end credit plan if a security interest has already been retained or acquired and such advances are in accordance with a previously established credit limit for such plan.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limit for exercise of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under <uscode edition="2012" section="1640" title="15">section 1640 of this title</uscode> for violations of this subchapter not relating to the right to rescind.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitation on rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor shall have no rescission rights arising solely from the form of written notice used by the creditor to inform the obligor of the rights of the obligor under this section, if the creditor provided the obligor the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Bureau, or a comparable written notice of the rights of the obligor, that was properly completed by the creditor, and otherwise complied with all other requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rescission rights in foreclosure</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_i_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding <uscode edition="2012" section="1649" title="15">section 1649 of this title</uscode>, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f) of this section, in addition to any other right of rescission available under this section for a transaction, after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the primary dwelling of an obligor securing an extension of credit, the obligor shall have a right to rescind the transaction equivalent to other rescission rights provided by this section, if—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a mortgage broker fee is not included in the finance charge in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect at the time the consumer credit transaction was consummated; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the form of notice of rescission for the transaction is not the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Bureau or a comparable written notice, and otherwise complied with all the requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tolerance for disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2012" section="1605" title="15">section 1605(f) of this title</uscode>, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f) of this section, for the purposes of exercising any rescission rights after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the principal dwelling of the obligor securing an extension of credit, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this section if the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $35 or is greater than the amount required to be disclosed under this subchapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Right of recoupment under State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission in recoupment under State law.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A good faith estimate, based on accepted industry standards, of the creditor or servicer of the amount of the monthly payment that will apply after the date of the adjustment or reset, and the assumptions on which this estimate is based.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A list of alternatives consumers may pursue before the date of adjustment or reset, and descriptions of the actions consumers must take to pursue these alternatives, including—</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a servicer of residential mortgages agrees to enter into a qualified loss mitigation plan with respect to 1 or more residential mortgages originated before May 20, 2009, including mortgages held in a securitization or other investment vehicle—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to investors or other parties to maximize the net present value of such mortgages, the duty shall be construed to apply to all such investors and parties, and not to any individual party or group of parties; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied the duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, before December 31, 2012, the servicer implements a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the following criteria:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has occurred, is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as such terms are defined by guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [<uscode edition="2012" section="5201" title="12">12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.</uscode>].</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, that the application of such qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors or other parties under this section shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection (a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The qualified loss mitigation plan guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [<uscode edition="2012" section="5201" title="12">12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.</uscode>] shall constitute standard industry practice for purposes of all Federal and State laws.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, including a trustee, issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each servicer that engages in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results of the servicer's modification activities.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ability to repay</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Bureau, no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the creditor knows, or has reason to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination under this subsection of a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer's credit history, current income, expected income the consumer is reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-to-income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations, employment status, and other financial resources other than the consumer's equity in the dwelling or real property that secures repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor making a residential mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer's Internal Revenue Service Form W–2, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in making a determination under this subsection shall include the verification of such income by the use of—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax returns; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies income documentation by a third party subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to loans made, guaranteed, or insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), such departments or agencies may exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this income verification requirement as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due on the prior existing residential mortgage loan.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The refinancing does not increase the principal balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section 1602(aa)(4) <sup><a href="#1639c_1_target" name="1639c_1">1</a></sup> of this title, other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator) payable in connection with the refinancing do not exceed 3 percent of the total new loan amount.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower than the interest rate of the original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that the department or agency shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in a balloon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5_G"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced and the refinancing satisfy all requirements of the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nonstandard loans</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_A"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Variable rate loans that defer repayment of any principal or interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any principal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing repayment schedule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_B"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest-only loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires the payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the payment amount required to amortize the loan by its final maturity.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_C"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Calculation for negative amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall also take into consideration any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization provision.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_D"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Calculation process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall calculate the monthly payment amount for principal and interest on any residential mortgage loan by assuming—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_D_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on the date of the consummation of the loan;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_D_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal monthly amortizing payments for principal and interest over the entire term of the loan with no balloon payment, unless the loan contract requires more rapid repayment (including balloon payment), in which case the calculation shall be made (I) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Bureau, with respect to any loan which has an annual percentage rate that does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is set, by 1.5 or more percentage points for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and by 3.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; or (II) using the contract's repayment schedule, with respect to a loan which has an annual percentage rate, as of the date the interest rate is set, that is at least 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and 3.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_D_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the interest rate over the entire term of the loan is a fixed rate equal to the fully indexed rate at the time of the loan closing, without considering the introductory rate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_E"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Refinance of hybrid loans with current lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In considering any application for refinancing an existing hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard loan to be made by the same creditor in any case in which there would be a reduction in monthly payment and the mortgagor has not been delinquent on any payment on the existing hybrid loan, the creditor may—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_E_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consider the mortgagor's good standing on the existing mortgage;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_E_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consider if the extension of new credit would prevent a likely default should the original mortgage reset and give such concerns a higher priority as an acceptable underwriting practice; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6_E_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) offer rate discounts and other favorable terms to such mortgagor that would be available to new customers with high credit ratings based on such underwriting practice.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_7"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Fully-indexed rate defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term "fully indexed rate" means the index rate prevailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan is made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration of any introductory interest rates.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_8"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Reverse mortgages and bridge loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply with respect to any reverse mortgage or temporary or bridge loan with a term of 12 months or less, including to any loan to purchase a new dwelling where the consumer plans to sell a different dwelling within 12 months.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_9"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Seasonal income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If documented income, including income from a small business, is a repayment source for a residential mortgage loan, a creditor may consider the seasonality and irregularity of such income in the underwriting of and scheduling of payments for such credit.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of ability to repay</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any creditor with respect to any residential mortgage loan, and any assignee of such loan subject to liability under this subchapter, may presume that the loan has met the requirements of subsection (a), if the loan is a qualified mortgage.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A_i_II"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) except as provided in subparagraph (E), allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A_ii"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A_vii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) for which the total points and fees (as defined in subparagraph (C)) payable in connection with the loan do not exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount;</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Average prime offer rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term "average prime offer rate" means the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date on which the interest rate for the transaction is set, as published by the Bureau..<sup><a href="#1639c_2_target" name="1639c_2">2</a></sup></p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Points and fees</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C_ii"></a>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Computation</h4>

In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditor's billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the obligor's account is not restricted or closed because of the failure of the obligor to pay the amount indicated under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disadvantages of garnishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for personal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in interstate commerce.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors&amp;apos; remedy frequently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the resulting disruption of employment, production, and consumption constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The great disparities among the laws of the several States relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many areas of the country.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessity for regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of this subchapter are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bankruptcy laws.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any credit repair organization shall provide any consumer with the following written statement before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><strong>"Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law</strong></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">"You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any &amp;apos;credit repair&amp;apos; company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">"The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For more information contact:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a copy of an identity theft report;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the information may be a result of identity theft;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that an identity theft report has been filed;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that a block has been requested under this section; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) of the effective dates of the block.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to decline or rescind</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification to consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under <uscode detail="(a)(5)(B)" edition="2012" section="1681i" title="15">section 1681i(a)(5)(B) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Significance of block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for resellers</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No reseller file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a reseller;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reseller with file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for verification companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="2012" section="1681a" title="15">section 1681a(p) of this title</uscode>, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.</p>

Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.</p>

<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003] (commonly referred to as &amp;apos;FACTA&amp;apos;) [<plaw congress="108" isprivate="false" number="159">Pub. L. 108–159,</plaw> see Short Title of 2003 Amendment note set out under <uscode edition="2012" section="1601" title="15">section 1601 of this title</uscode>] was enacted into law in 2003 and 1 of the purposes of such Act is to prevent criminals from obtaining access to consumers&amp;apos; private financial and credit information in order to reduce identity theft and credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) As part of that law, the Congress enacted a requirement, through an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act [<uscode edition="2012" section="1681" title="15">15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.</uscode>], that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) Many merchants understood that this requirement would be satisfied by truncating the account number down to the last 5 digits based in part on the language of the provision as well as the publicity in the aftermath of the passage of the law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) Almost immediately after the deadline for compliance passed, hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act even where the account number was properly truncated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) None of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer's identity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) Experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, by itself as required by the amendment made by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003], regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(7) Despite repeatedly being denied class certification, the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.—The purpose of this Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and <uscode edition="2012" section="1601" title="15">section 1601 of this title</uscode>] is to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers."</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requests for signature of husband and wife for creation of valid lien, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for the signature of both parties to a marriage for the purpose of creating a valid lien, passing clear title, waiving inchoate rights to property, or assigning earnings, shall not constitute discrimination under this subchapter: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this provision shall not be construed to permit a creditor to take sex or marital status into account in connection with the evaluation of creditworthiness of any applicant.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State property laws affecting creditworthiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consideration or application of State property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State laws prohibiting separate extension of consumer credit to husband and wife</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any provision of State law which prohibits the separate extension of consumer credit to each party to a marriage shall not apply in any case where each party to a marriage voluntarily applies for separate credit from the same creditor: <i>Provided</i>, That in any case where such a State law is so preempted, each party to the marriage shall be solely responsible for the debt so contracted.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Combining credit accounts of husband and wife with same creditor to determine permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under Federal or State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When each party to a marriage separately and voluntarily applies for and obtains separate credit accounts with the same creditor, those accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or permissible loan ceilings under the laws of any State or of the United States.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Election of remedies under subchapter or State law; nature of relief determining applicability</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with inconsistent State laws; determination of inconsistency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to credit discrimination, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. The Bureau is authorized to determine whether such inconsistencies exist. The Bureau may not determine that any State law is inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter if the Bureau determines that such law gives greater protection to the applicant.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Abusive practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inadequacy of laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Existing laws and procedures for redressing these injuries are inadequate to protect consumers.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Available non-abusive collection methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Means other than misrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Abusive debt collection practices are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate commerce and through means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rights and liabilities undefined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the use of electronic systems to transfer funds provides the potential for substantial benefits to consumers. However, due to the unique characteristics of such systems, the application of existing consumer protection legislation is unclear, leaving the rights and liabilities of consumers, financial institutions, and intermediaries in electronic fund transfers undefined.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund and remittance transfer systems. The primary objective of this subchapter, however, is the provision of individual consumer rights.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notification to financial institution of error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a financial institution, within sixty days after having transmitted to a consumer documentation pursuant to <uscode detail="(a), (c), or (d)" edition="2012" section="1693d" title="15">section 1693d(a), (c), or (d) of this title</uscode> or notification pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2012" section="1693d" title="15">section 1693d(b) of this title</uscode>, receives oral or written notice in which the consumer—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sets forth or otherwise enables the financial institution to identify the name and account number of the consumer;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicates the consumer's belief that the documentation, or, in the case of notification pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2012" section="1693d" title="15">section 1693d(b) of this title</uscode>, the consumer's account, contains an error and the amount of such error; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the consumer's belief (where applicable) that an error has occurred,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the financial institution shall investigate the alleged error, determine whether an error has occurred, and report or mail the results of such investigation and determination to the consumer within ten business days. The financial institution may require written confirmation to be provided to it within ten business days of an oral notification of error if, when the oral notification is made, the consumer is advised of such requirement and the address to which such confirmation should be sent. A financial institution which requires written confirmation in accordance with the previous sentence need not provisionally recredit a consumer's account in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, nor shall the financial institution be liable under subsection (e) of this section if the written confirmation is not received within the ten-day period referred to in the previous sentence.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of error; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines that an error did occur, it shall promptly, but in no event more than one business day after such determination, correct the error, subject to <uscode edition="2012" section="1693g" title="15">section 1693g of this title</uscode>, including the crediting of interest where applicable.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provisional recredit of consumer's account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a financial institution receives notice of an error in the manner and within the time period specified in subsection (a) of this section, it may, in lieu of the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, within ten business days after receiving such notice provisionally recredit the consumer's account for the amount alleged to be in error, subject to <uscode edition="2012" section="1693g" title="15">section 1693g of this title</uscode>, including interest where applicable, pending the conclusion of its investigation and its determination of whether an error has occurred. Such investigation shall be concluded not later than forty-five days after receipt of notice of the error. During the pendency of the investigation, the consumer shall have full use of the funds provisionally recredited.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Absence of error; finding; explanation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines after its investigation pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section that an error did not occur, it shall deliver or mail to the consumer an explanation of its findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of its investigation, and upon request of the consumer promptly deliver or mail to the consumer reproductions of all documents which the financial institution relied on to conclude that such error did not occur. The financial institution shall include notice of the right to request reproductions with the explanation of its findings.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treble damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body"> If in any action under section 1693m <sup><a href="#1693f_1_target" name="1693f_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the court finds that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial institution did not provisionally recredit a consumer's account within the ten-day period specified in subsection (c) of this section, and the financial institution (A) did not make a good faith investigation of the alleged error, or (B) did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the consumer's account was not in error; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the financial institution knowingly and willfully concluded that the consumer's account was not in error when such conclusion could not reasonably have been drawn from the evidence available to the financial institution at the time of its investigation,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the consumer shall be entitled to treble damages determined under section 1693m(a)(1) <sup><a href="#1693f_1_target" name="1693f_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acts constituting error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, an error consists of—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an unauthorized electronic fund transfer;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an incorrect electronic fund transfer from or to the consumer's account;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the omission from a periodic statement of an electronic fund transfer affecting the consumer's account which should have been included;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a computational error by the financial institution;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the consumer's receipt of an incorrect amount of money from an electronic terminal;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a consumer's request for additional information or clarification concerning an electronic fund transfer or any documentation required by this subchapter; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) any other error described in regulations of the Bureau.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unauthorized electronic fund transfers; limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer shall be liable for any unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the account of such consumer only if the card or other means of access utilized for such transfer was an accepted card or other meanas <sup><a href="#1693g_1_target" name="1693g_1">1</a></sup> of access and if the issuer of such card, code, or other means of access has provided a means whereby the user of such card, code, or other means of access can be identified as the person authorized to use it, such as by signature, photograph, or fingerprint or by electronic or mechanical confirmation. In no event, however, shall a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer exceed the lesser of—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $50; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of money or value of property or services obtained in such unauthorized electronic fund transfer prior to the time the financial institution is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of, circumstances which lead to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account has been or may be effected. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient when such steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the financial institution with the pertinent information, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the financial institution does in fact receive such information.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report within sixty days of transmittal of the statement (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a reasonable time under the circumstances) any unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error which appears on the periodic statement provided to the consumer under <uscode edition="2012" section="1693d" title="15">section 1693d of this title</uscode>. In addition, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses which the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report any loss or theft of a card or other means of access within two business days after the consumer learns of the loss or theft (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a longer period which is reasonable under the circumstances), but the consumer's liability under this subsection in any such case may not exceed a total of $500, or the amount of unauthorized electronic fund transfers which occur following the close of two business days (or such longer period) after the consumer learns of the loss or theft but prior to notice to the financial institution under this subsection, whichever is less.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action which involves a consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the electronic fund transfer was authorized or, if the electronic fund transfer was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to establish that the conditions of liability set forth in subsection (a) of this section have been met, and, if the transfer was initiated after the effective date of <uscode edition="2012" section="1693c" title="15">section 1693c of this title</uscode>, that the disclosures required to be made to the consumer under section 1693c(a)(1) and (2) of this title were in fact made in accordance with such section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of limitation on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a transaction which involves both an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and an extension of credit as defined in section 1602(e) <sup><a href="#1693g_2_target" name="1693g_2">2</a></sup> of this title pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn, the limitation on the consumer's liability for such transaction shall be determined solely in accordance with this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restriction on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a consumer for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer in excess of his liability for such a transfer under other applicable law or under any agreement with the consumer's financial institution.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Scope of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, a consumer incurs no liability from an unauthorized electronic fund transfer.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to electronic fund transfers, dormancy fees, inactivity charges or fees, service fees, or expiration dates of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by this subchapter. The Bureau shall, upon its own motion or upon the request of any financial institution, State, or other interested party, submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, determine whether a State requirement is inconsistent or affords greater protection. If the Bureau determines that a State requirement is inconsistent, financial institutions shall incur no liability under the law of that State for a good faith failure to comply with that law, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason. This subchapter does not extend the applicability of any such law to any class of persons or transactions to which it would not otherwise apply.</p>
