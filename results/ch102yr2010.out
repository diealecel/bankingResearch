§7601. Availability of contact lens prescriptions to patients

(a) In general
When a prescriber completes a contact lens fitting, the prescriber—
(1) whether or not requested by the patient, shall provide to the patient a copy of the contact lens prescription; and
(2) shall, as directed by any person designated to act on behalf of the patient, provide or verify the contact lens prescription by electronic or other means.

(b) Limitations
A prescriber may not—
(1) require purchase of contact lenses from the prescriber or from another person as a condition of providing a copy of a prescription under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or verification of a prescription under subsection (a)(2);

§7602. Immediate payment of fees in limited circumstances
A prescriber may require payment of fees for an eye examination, fitting, and evaluation before the release of a contact lens prescription, but only if the prescriber requires immediate payment in the case of an examination that reveals no requirement for ophthalmic goods. For purposes of the preceding sentence, presentation of proof of insurance coverage for that service shall be deemed to be a payment.

The prescriber shall specify the basis for the inaccuracy or invalidity of the prescription. If the prescription communicated by the seller to the prescriber is inaccurate, the prescriber shall correct it.

A contact lens prescription shall expire—
(1) on the date specified by the law of the State in which the prescription was written, if that date is one year or more after the issue date of the prescription;
(2) not less than one year after the issue date of the prescription if such State law specifies no date or a date that is less than one year after the issue date of the prescription; or

§7606. Prohibition of certain waivers
A prescriber may not place on the prescription, or require the patient to sign, or deliver to the patient a form or notice waiving or disclaiming the liability or responsibility of the prescriber for the accuracy of the eye examination.
