§5901. Findings
Congress finds that—
(1) the distribution of goods and services to consumers in the United States requires the free flow of currency, bullion, securities, food stamps, and other items of unusual value in interstate commerce;
(2) the armored car industry transports and protects such items in interstate commerce, including daily transportation of currency and food stamps valued at more than $1,000,000,000;
(3) armored car crew members are often subject to armed attack by individuals attempting to steal such items;
(4) to protect themselves and the items they transport, such crew members are armed with weapons;
(5) various States require both weapons training and a criminal record background check before licensing a crew member to carry a weapon; and
(6) there is a need for each State to reciprocally accept weapons licenses of other States for armored car crew members to assure the free and safe transport of valuable items in interstate commerce.

§5902. State reciprocity of weapons licenses issued to armored car company crew members

(a) In general
If an armored car crew member employed by an armored car company has in effect a license issued by the appropriate State agency (in the State in which such member is primarily employed by such company) to carry a weapon while acting in the services of such company in that State, and such State agency meets the minimum State requirements under subsection (b) of this section, then such crew member shall be entitled to lawfully carry any weapon to which such license relates in any State while such crew member is acting in the service of such company.

(b) Minimum State requirements
A State agency meets the minimum State requirements of this subsection if in issuing a weapons license to an armored car crew member described in subsection (a) of this section, the agency requires the crew member to provide information on an annual basis to the satisfaction of the agency that—
(1) the crew member has received classroom and range training in weapons safety and marksmanship during the current year by a qualified instructor for each weapon that the crew member is licensed to carry; and
(2) the receipt or possession of a weapon by the crew member would not violate Federal law, determined on the basis of a criminal record background check conducted during the current year.
