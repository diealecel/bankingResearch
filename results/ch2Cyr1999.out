§79. Short title of chapter
This chapter may be cited as the "Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935".

§79a. Necessity for control of holding companies

(a) Interstate nature of holding companies
Public-utility holding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected with a national public interest in that, among other things, (1) their securities are widely marketed and distributed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and are sold to a large number of investors in different States; (2) their service, sales, construction, and other contracts and arrangements are often made and performed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (3) their subsidiary public-utility companies often sell and transport gas and electric energy by the use of means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (4) their practices in respect of and control over subsidiary companies often materially affect the interstate commerce in which those companies engage; (5) their activities extending over many States are not susceptible of effective control by any State and make difficult, if not impossible, effective State regulation of public-utility companies.

(b) Protection of investors and interests of consumers
Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Federal Trade Commission made pursuant to S. Res. 83 (Seventieth Congress, first session), the reports of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, made pursuant to H. Res. 59 (Seventy-second Congress, first session) and H. J. Res. 572 (Seventy-second Congress, second session) and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is declared that the national public interest, the interest of investors in the securities of holding companies and their subsidiary companies and affiliates, and the interest of consumers of electric energy and natural and manufactured gas, are or may be adversely affected—
(1) when such investors cannot obtain the information necessary to appraise the financial position or earning power of the issuers, because of the absence of uniform standard accounts; when such securities are issued without the approval or consent of the States having jurisdiction over subsidiary public-utility companies; when such securities are issued upon the basis of fictitious or unsound asset values having no fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the properties and upon the basis of paper profits from intercompany transactions, or in anticipation of excessive revenues from subsidiary public-utility companies; when such securities are issued by a subsidiary public-utility company under circumstances which subject such company to the burden of supporting an overcapitalized structure and tend to prevent voluntary rate reductions;
(2) when subsidiary public-utility companies are subjected to excessive charges for services, construction work, equipment, and materials, or enter into transactions in which evils result from an absence of arm's-length bargaining or from restraint of free and independent competition; when service, management, construction, and other contracts involve the allocation of charges among subsidiary public-utility companies in different States so as to present problems of regulation which cannot be dealt with effectively by the States;
(3) when control of subsidiary public-utility companies affects the accounting practices and rate, dividend, and other policies of such companies so as to complicate and obstruct State regulation of such companies, or when control of such companies is exerted through disproportionately small investment;
(4) when the growth and extension of holding companies bears no relation to economy of management and operation or the integration and coordination of related operating properties; or
(5) when in any other respect there is lack of economy of management and operation of public-utility companies or lack of efficiency and adequacy of service rendered by such companies, or lack of effective public regulation, or lack of economies in the raising of capital.

(c) Declaration of policy of chapter
When abuses of the character above enumerated become persistent and wide-spread the holding company becomes an agency which, unless regulated, is injurious to investors, consumers, and the general public; and it is declared to be the policy of this chapter, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate the evils as enumerated in this section, connected with public-utility holding companies which are engaged in interstate commerce or in activities which directly affect or burden interstate commerce; and for the purpose of effectuating such policy to compel the simplification of public-utility holding-company systems and the elimination therefrom of properties detrimental to the proper functioning of such systems, and to provide as soon as practicable for the elimination of public-utility holding companies except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.

§79b. Definitions; application of chapter

(a) Definitions
When used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires—
(1) "Person" means an individual or company.
(2) "Company" means a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, a business trust, or an organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not; or any receiver, trustee, or other liquidating agent of any of the foregoing in his capacity as such.
(3) "Electric utility company" means any company which owns or operates facilities used for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale, other than sale to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale. The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare a company operating any such facilities not to be an electric utility company if the Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged in one or more businesses other than the business of an electric utility company, and by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold by such company it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such company be considered an electric utility company for the purposes of this chapter, or (B) such company is one operating within a single State, and substantially all of its outstanding securities are owned directly or indirectly by another company to which such operating company sells or furnishes electric energy which it generates; such other company uses and does not resell such electric energy, is engaged primarily in manufacturing (other than the manufacturing of electric energy or gas) and is not controlled by any other company; and by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold or furnished by such operating company to other persons it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that it be considered an electric utility company for the purposes of this chapter. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company (and the owner of the facilities operated by such company) from the application of this paragraph until the Commission has acted upon such application. As a condition to the entry of any such order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such order, and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports regarding the business of the company as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to insure that such company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application, shall revoke such order whenever it finds that the conditions specified in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph are not satisfied in the case of such company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by the company in respect of which the order is to be issued or by the owner of the facilities operated by such company. Any order issued under this paragraph shall apply equally to such company and such owner. The Commission may by rules or regulations conditionally or unconditionally provide that any specified class or classes of companies which it determines to satisfy the conditions specified in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph, and the owners of the facilities operated by such companies, shall not be deemed electric utility companies within the meaning of this paragraph.
(4) "Gas utility company" means any company which owns or operates facilities used for the distribution at retail (other than distribution only in enclosed portable containers, or distribution to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale) of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power. The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare a company operating any such facilities not to be a gas utility company if the Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged in one or more businesses other than the business of a gas utility company, and (B) by reason of the small amount of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by such company it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such company be considered a gas utility company for the purposes of this chapter. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company (and the owner of the facilities operated by such company) from the application of this paragraph until the Commission has acted upon such application. As a condition to the entry of any such order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such order, and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports regarding the business of the company as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to insure that such company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application, shall revoke such order whenever it finds that the conditions specified in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph are not satisfied in the case of such company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by the company in respect of which the order is to be issued or by the owner of the facilities operated by such company. Any order issued under this paragraph shall apply equally to such company and such owner. The Commission may by rules or regulations conditionally or unconditionally provide that any specified class or classes of companies which it determines to satisfy the conditions specified in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph, and the owners of the facilities operated by such companies, shall not be deemed gas utility companies within the meaning of this paragraph.
(5) "Public-utility company" means an electric utility company or a gas utility company.
(6) "Commission" means the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(B) any person which the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, directly or indirectly to exercise (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) such a controlling influence over the management or policies of any public-utility or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such person be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this chapter upon holding companies.
The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare that a company is not a holding company under clause (A) of this paragraph if the Commission finds that the applicant (i) does not, either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly control a public-utility or holding company either through one or more intermediary persons or by any means or device whatsoever, (ii) is not an intermediary company through which such control is exercised, and (iii) does not, directly or indirectly, exercise (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) such a controlling influence over the management or policies of any public-utility or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the applicant be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this chapter upon holding companies. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith by a company other than a registered holding company shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this chapter upon the applicant as a holding company, until the Commission has acted upon such application. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of any application hereunder, the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of, such application. As a condition to the entry of any order granting such application and as a part of any such order, the Commission may require the applicant to apply periodically for a renewal of such order and to do or refrain from doing such acts or things, in respect of exercise of voting rights, control over proxies, designation of officers and directors, existence of interlocking officers, directors and other relationships, and submission of periodic or special reports regarding affiliations or intercorporate relationships of the applicant, as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to ensure that in the case of the applicant the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph are satisfied during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application of the company affected, shall revoke the order declaring such company not to be a holding company whenever in its judgment any condition specified in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph is not satisfied in the case of such company, or modify the terms of such order whenever in its judgment such modification is necessary to ensure that in the case of such company the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph are satisfied during the period for which such order is effective. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order.
(8) "Subsidiary company" of a specified holding company means—
(A) any company 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such holding company (or by a company that is a subsidiary company of such holding company by virtue of this clause or clause (B) of this paragraph), unless the Commission, as hereinafter provided, by order declares such company not to be a subsidiary company of such holding company; and
(B) any person the management or policies of which the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines to be subject to a controlling influence, directly or indirectly, by such holding company (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) so as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such person be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this chapter upon subsidiary companies of holding companies.
The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare that a company is not a subsidiary company of a specified holding company under clause (A) of this paragraph if the Commission finds that (i) the applicant is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by such holding company (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) either through one or more intermediary persons or by any means or device whatsoever, (ii) the applicant is not an intermediary company through which such control of another company is exercised, and (iii) the management or policies of the applicant are not subject to a controlling influence, directly or indirectly, by such holding company (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) so as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the applicant be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this chapter upon subsidiary companies of holding companies. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this chapter upon the applicant as a subsidiary company of such specified holding company until the Commission has acted upon such application. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of any application hereunder, the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of, such application. As a condition to the entry of, and as a part of, any order granting such application, the Commission may require the applicant to apply periodically for a renewal of such order and to file such periodic or special reports regarding the affiliations or intercorporate relationships of the applicant as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to enable it to determine whether in the case of the applicant the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph are satisfied during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application, shall revoke the order declaring such company not to be a subsidiary company whenever in its judgment any condition specified in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph is not satisfied in the case of such company, or modify the terms of such order whenever in its judgment such modification is necessary to ensure that in the case of such company the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph are satisfied during the period for which such order is effective.

(a) Exemption of holding companies
The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, shall exempt any holding company, and every subsidiary company thereof as such, from any provision or provisions of this chapter, unless and except insofar as it finds the exemption detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers, if—
(1) such holding company, and every subsidiary company thereof which is a public-utility company from which such holding company derives, directly or indirectly, any material part of its income, are predominantly intrastate in character and carry on their business substantially in a single State in which such holding company and every such subsidiary company thereof are organized;
(2) such holding company is predominantly a public-utility company whose operations as such do not extend beyond the State in which it is organized and States contiguous thereto;

The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the issue, renewal, or guaranty by a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof of a note or draft (including the pledge of any security as collateral therefor) if such note or draft (1) is not part of a public offering, (2) matures or is renewed for not more than nine months, exclusive of days of grace, after the date of such issue, renewal, or guaranty thereof, and (3) aggregates (together with all other then outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of nine months or less, exclusive of days of grace, as to which such company is primarily or secondarily liable) not more than 5 per centum of the principal amount and par value of the other securities of such company then outstanding, or such greater per centum thereof as the Commission upon application may by order authorize as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. In the case of securities having no principal amount or no par value, the value for the purposes of this subsection shall be the fair market value as of the date of issue. The Commission by rules and regulations or order, subject to such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, shall exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) of this section the issue or sale of any security by any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, if the issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary company and have been expressly authorized by the State commission of the State in which such subsidiary company is organized and doing business, or if the issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary company when such subsidiary company is not a holding company, a public-utility company, an investment company, or a fiscal or financing agency of a holding company, a public utility company, or an investment company. The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the issue, by a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, of a security issued pursuant to the terms of any security outstanding on January 1, 1935, giving the holder of such outstanding security the right to convert such outstanding security into another security of the same issuer or of another person, or giving the right to subscribe to another security of the same issuer or another issuer. Within ten days after any issue, sale, renewal, or guaranty exempted from the application of subsection (a) of this section by or under authority of this subsection, such holding company or subsidiary company thereof shall file with the Commission a certificate of notification in such form and setting forth such of the information required in a declaration under section 79g of this title as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

(d) Conditions having permission of effectiveness
If the requirements of subsections (c) and (g) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall permit a declaration regarding the issue or sale of a security to become effective unless the Commission finds that—

(5) in the case of a security that is a guaranty of, or assumption of liability on, a security of another company, the circumstances are such as to constitute the making of such guaranty or the assumption of such liability an improper risk for the declarant; or
(6) the terms and conditions of the issue or sale of the security are detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.

If the requirements of subsection (f) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall approve the acquisition unless the Commission finds that—

(2) in case of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, the consideration, including all fees, commissions, and other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, to be given, directly or indirectly, in connection with such acquisition is not reasonable or does not bear a fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the utility assets to be acquired or the utility assets underlying the securities to be acquired; or
(3) such acquisition will unduly complicate the capital structure of the holding-company system of the applicant or will be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers or the proper functioning of such holding-company system.

§79k. Simplification of holding company systems

(a) Examination by Commission with view to simplification
It shall be the duty of the Commission to examine the corporate structure of every registered holding company and subsidiary company thereof, the relationships among the companies in the holding-company system of every such company and the character of the interests thereof and the properties owned or controlled thereby to determine the extent to which the corporate structure of such holding-company system and the companies therein may be simplified, unnecessary complexities therein eliminated, voting power fairly and equitably distributed among the holders of securities thereof, and the properties and business thereof confined to those necessary or appropriate to the operations of an integrated public-utility system.

(b) Limitations on operations of holding company systems
It shall be the duty of the Commission, as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938:
(1) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such action as the Commission shall find necessary to limit the operations of the holding-company system of which such company is a part to a single integrated public-utility system, and to such other businesses as are reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utility system: Provided, however, That the Commission shall permit a registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional integrated public-utility systems, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that—
(A) Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system;
(B) All of such additional systems are located in one State, or in adjoining States, or in a contiguous foreign country; and
(C) The continued combination of such systems under the control of such holding company is not so large (considering the state of the art and the area or region affected) as to impair the advantages of localized management, efficient operation, or the effectiveness of regulation.
The Commission may permit as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of one or more integrated public-utility systems the retention of an interest in any business (other than the business of a public-utility company as such) which the Commission shall find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and not detrimental to the proper functioning of such system or systems.
(2) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such steps as the Commission shall find necessary to ensure that the corporate structure or continued existence of any company in the holding-company system does not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure, or unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders, of such holding-company system. In carrying out the provisions of this paragraph the Commission shall require each registered holding company (and any company in the same holding-company system with such holding company) to take such action as the Commission shall find necessary in order that such holding company shall cease to be a holding company with respect to each of its subsidiary companies which itself has a subsidiary company which is a holding company. Except for the purpose of fairly and equitably distributing voting power among the security holders of such company, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to require any change in the corporate structure or existence of any company which is not a holding company, or of any company whose principal business is that of a public-utility company.
The Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that the conditions upon which the order was predicated do not exist. Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 79x of this title.

(c) Time for compliance with order limiting operations
Any order under subsection (b) of this section shall be complied with within one year from the date of such order; but the Commission shall, upon a showing (made before or after the entry of such order) that the applicant has been or will be unable in the exercise of due diligence to comply with such order within such time, extend such time for an additional period not exceeding one year if it finds such extension necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

(d) Court enforcement of order for simplification; appointment of trustee; disposition of assets; reorganization plan
The Commission may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) 1 of section 79r of this title, to enforce compliance with any order issued under subsection (b) of this section. In any such proceeding, the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for purposes of enforcement of such order, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction, in any such proceeding, to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed. In any proceeding for the enforcement of an order of the Commission issued under subsection (b) of this section, the trustee with the approval of the court shall have power to dispose of any or all of such assets and, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, may make such disposition in accordance with a fair and equitable reorganization plan which shall have been approved by the Commission after opportunity for hearing. Such reorganization plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission, or, subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, by any person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization.

(e) Submission by company of plan for simplification; court enforcement of order of approval; appointment of trustee
In accordance with such rules and regulations or order as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, any registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered holding company may, at any time after January 1, 1936, submit a plan to the Commission for the divestment of control, securities, or other assets, or for other action by such company or any subsidiary company thereof for the purpose of enabling such company or any subsidiary company thereof to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall find such plan, as submitted or as modified, necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and fair and equitable to the persons affected by such plan, the Commission shall make an order approving such plan; and the Commission, at the request of the company, may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) 1 of section 79r of this title, to enforce and carry out the terms and provisions of such plan. If, upon any such application, the court, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall approve such plan as fair and equitable and as appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this section, the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out the terms and provisions of such plan, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer, under the direction of the court and in accordance with the plan theretofore approved by the court and the Commission, the assets so possessed.

(f) Commission as trustee; submission of reorganization plan by Commission or interested party
In any proceeding in a court of the United States, whether under this section or otherwise, in which a receiver or trustee is appointed for any registered holding company, or any subsidiary company thereof, the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee or receiver, subject to the directions and orders of the court, whether or not a trustee or receiver shall theretofore have been appointed, and in any such proceeding the court shall not appoint any person other than the Commission as trustee or receiver without notifying the Commission and giving it an opportunity to be heard before making any such appointment. In no proceeding under this section or otherwise shall the Commission be appointed as trustee or receiver without its express consent. In any such proceeding a reorganization plan for a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof shall not become effective unless such plan shall have been approved by the Commission after opportunity for hearing prior to its submission to the court. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such reorganization plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission or, subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, by any person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations or order as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, require that any or all fees, expenses, and remuneration, to whomsoever paid, in connection with any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, case under title 11, or receivership of a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, in any such proceeding, shall be subject to approval by the Commission.

(g) Solicitation of proxies, powers of attorney, etc., in respect of reorganization plan
It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or permit the use of his or its name to solicit, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, any proxy, consent, authorization, power of attorney, deposit, or dissent in respect of any reorganization plan of a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof under this section, or otherwise, or in respect of any plan under this section for the divestment of control, securities, or other assets, or for the dissolution of any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, unless—
(1) the plan has been proposed by the Commission, or the plan and such information regarding it and its sponsors as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers has been submitted to the Commission by a person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in such reorganization;
(2) each such solicitation is accompanied or preceded by a copy of a report on the plan which shall be made by the Commission after an opportunity for a hearing on the plan and other plans submitted to it, or by an abstract of such report made or approved by the Commission; and
(3) each such solicitation is made not in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
Nothing in this subsection or the rules and regulations thereunder shall prevent any person from appearing before the Commission or any court through an attorney or proxy.

This provision shall not apply to such transactions, involving special or unusual circumstances or not in the ordinary course of business, as the Commission by rules and regulations or order may conditionally or unconditionally exempt as being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

The rules and regulations and orders of the Commission under this section may prescribe, among other things, such terms and conditions regarding the determination of costs and the allocation thereof among specified classes of companies and for specified classes of service, sales, and construction contracts, the duration of such contracts, the making and keeping of accounts and cost-accounting procedures, the filing of annual and other periodic and special reports, the maintenance of competitive conditions, the disclosure of interests, and similar matters, as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

The Commission shall not approve, or continue the approval of, any company as a mutual service company unless the Commission finds such company is so organized as to ownership, costs, revenues, and the sharing thereof as reasonably to insure the efficient and economical performance of service, sales, or construction contracts by such company for member companies, at cost fairly and equitably allocated among such member companies, at a reasonable saving to member companies over the cost to such companies of comparable contracts performed by independent persons. The Commission, upon its own motion or at the request of a member company or a State commission, may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order require a reallocation or reapportionment of costs among member companies of a mutual service company if it finds the existing allocation inequitable and may require the elimination of a service or services to a member company which does not bear its fair proportion of costs or which, by reason of its size or other circumstances, does not require such service or services. The Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order shall revoke, suspend, or modify the approval given any mutual service company if it finds that such company has persistently violated any provision of this section or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who, without just cause, shall fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records, if in his or its power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.

Any person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission under this chapter may obtain a review of such order in the United States court of appeals within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by the Commission for that purpose, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order.

§79z–5a. Exempt wholesale generators

(a) Definitions
For purposes of this section—

(1) Exempt wholesale generator
The term "exempt wholesale generator" means any person determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be engaged directly, or indirectly through one or more affiliates as defined in section 79b(a)(11)(B) of this title, and exclusively in the business of owning or operating, or both owning and operating, all or part of one or more eligible facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale. No person shall be deemed to be an exempt wholesale generator under this section unless such person has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination under this paragraph. A person applying in good faith for such a determination shall be deemed an exempt wholesale generator under this section, with all of the exemptions provided by this section, until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission makes such determination. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall make such determination within 60 days of its receipt of such application and shall notify the Commission whenever a determination is made under this paragraph that any person is an exempt wholesale generator. Not later than 12 months after October 24, 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall promulgate rules implementing the provisions of this paragraph. Applications for determination filed after the effective date of such rules shall be subject thereto.

(2) Eligible facility
The term "eligible facility" means a facility, wherever located, which is either—
(A) used for the generation of electric energy exclusively for sale at wholesale, or
(B) used for the generation of electric energy and leased to one or more public utility companies; Provided, That any such lease shall be treated as a sale of electric energy at wholesale for purposes of sections 824d and 824e of title 16.
Such term shall not include any facility for which consent is required under subsection (c) of this section if such consent has not been obtained. Such term includes interconnecting transmission facilities necessary to effect a sale of electric energy at wholesale. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "facility" may include a portion of a facility subject to the limitations of subsection (d) of this section and shall include a facility the construction of which has not been commenced or completed.

(3) Sale of electric energy at wholesale
The term "sale of electric energy at wholesale" shall have the same meaning as provided in section 824(d) of title 16.

(4) Retail rates and charges
The term "retail rates and charges" means rates and charges for the sale of electric energy directly to consumers.

(b) Foreign retail sales
Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section, retail sales of electric energy produced by a facility located in a foreign country shall not prevent such facility from being an eligible facility, or prevent a person owning or operating, or both owning and operating, such facility from being an exempt wholesale generator if none of the electric energy generated by such facility is sold to consumers in the United States.

(c) State consent for existing rate-based facilities
If a rate or charge for, or in connection with, the construction of a facility, or for electric energy produced by a facility (other than any portion of a rate or charge which represents recovery of the cost of a wholesale rate or charge) was in effect under the laws of any State as of October 24, 1992, in order for the facility to be considered an eligible facility, every State commission having jurisdiction over any such rate or charge must make a specific determination that allowing such facility to be an eligible facility (1) will benefit consumers, (2) is in the public interest, and (3) does not violate State law; Provided, That in the case of such a rate or charge which is a rate or charge of an affiliate of a registered holding company:
(A) such determination with respect to the facility in question shall be required from every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail rates and charges of the affiliates of such registered holding company; and
(B) the approval of the Commission under this chapter shall not be required for the transfer of the facility to an exempt wholesale generator.

(d) Hybrids
(1) No exempt wholesale generator may own or operate a portion of any facility if any other portion of the facility is owned or operated by an electric utility company that is an affiliate or associate company of such exempt wholesale generator.
(2) Eligible Facility.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an exempt wholesale generator may own or operate a portion of a facility identified in paragraph (1) if such portion has become an eligible facility as a result of the operation of subsection (c) of this section.

(e) Exemption of EWGS
An exempt wholesale generator shall not be considered an electric utility company under section 79b(a)(3) of this title and, whether or not a subsidiary company, an affiliate, or an associate company of a holding company, an exempt wholesale generator shall be exempt from all provisions of this chapter.

(f) Ownership of EWGS by exempt holding companies
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a holding company that is exempt under section 79c of this title shall be permitted, without condition or limitation under this chapter, to acquire and maintain an interest in the business of one or more exempt wholesale generators.

(g) Ownership of EWGS by registered holding companies
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter and the Commission's jurisdiction as provided under subsection (h) of this section, a registered holding company shall be permitted (without the need to apply for, or receive, approval from the Commission, and otherwise without condition under this chapter) to acquire and hold the securities, or an interest in the business, of one or more exempt wholesale generators.

(h) Financing and other relationships between EWGS and registered holding companies
The issuance of securities by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, the guarantee of securities of an exempt wholesale generator by a registered holding company, the entering into service, sales or construction contracts, and the creation or maintenance of any other relationship in addition to that described in subsection (g) of this section between an exempt wholesale generator and a registered holding company, its affiliates and associate companies, shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this chapter: Provided, That—
(1) section 79k of this title shall not prohibit the ownership of an interest in the business of one or more exempt wholesale generators by a registered holding company (regardless of where facilities owned or operated by such exempt wholesale generators are located), and such ownership by a registered holding company shall be deemed consistent with the operation of an integrated public utility system;
(2) the ownership of an interest in the business of one or more exempt wholesale generators by a registered holding company (regardless of where facilities owned or operated by such exempt wholesale generators are located) shall be considered as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate, to the operations of an integrated public utility system;
(3) in determining whether to approve (A) the issue or sale of a security by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, or (B) the guarantee of a security of an exempt wholesale generator by a registered holding company, the Commission shall not make a finding that such security is not reasonably adapted to the earning power of such company or to the security structure of such company and other companies in the same holding company system, or that the circumstances are such as to constitute the making of such guarantee an improper risk for such company, unless the Commission first finds that the issue or sale of such security, or the making of the guarantee, would have a substantial adverse impact on the financial integrity of the registered holding company system;
(4) in determining whether to approve (A) the issue or sale of a security by a registered holding company for purposes other than the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, or (B) other transactions by such registered holding company or by its subsidiaries other than with respect to exempt wholesale generators, the Commission shall not consider the effect of the capitalization or earnings of any subsidiary which is an exempt wholesale generator upon the registered holding company system, unless the approval of the issue or sale or other transaction, together with the effect of such capitalization and earnings, would have a substantial adverse impact on the financial integrity of the registered holding company system;
(5) the Commission shall make its decision under paragraph (3) to approve or disapprove the issue or sale of a security or the guarantee of a security within 120 days of the filing of a declaration concerning such issue, sale or guarantee; and
(6) the Commission shall promulgate regulations with respect to the actions which would be considered, for purposes of this subsection, to have a substantial adverse impact on the financial integrity of the registered holding company system; such regulations shall ensure that the action has no adverse impact on any utility subsidiary or its customers, or on the ability of State commissions to protect such subsidiary or customers, and shall take into account the amount and type of capital invested in exempt wholesale generators, the ratio of such capital to the total capital invested in utility operations, the availability of books and records, and the financial and operating experience of the registered holding company and the exempt wholesale generator; the Commission shall promulgate such regulations within 6 months after October 24, 1992; after such 6-month period the Commission shall not approve any actions under paragraph (3), (4) or (5) except in accordance with such issued regulations.

(i) Application of chapter to other eligible facilities
In the case of any person engaged directly and exclusively in the business of owning or operating (or both owning and operating) all or part of one or more eligible facilities, an advisory letter issued by the Commission staff under this chapter after October 24, 1992, or an order issued by the Commission under this chapter after October 24, 1992, shall not be required for the purpose, or have the effect, of exempting such person from treatment as an electric utility company under section 79b(a)(3) of this title or exempting such person from any provision of this chapter.

(j) Ownership of exempt wholesale generators and qualifying facilities
The ownership by a person of one or more exempt wholesale generators shall not result in such person being considered as being primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power within the meaning of sections 796(17)(C)(ii) and 796(18)(B)(ii) of title 16.

(k) Protection against abusive affiliate transactions

(1) Prohibition

(2) State authority to exempt from prohibition
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an electric utility company may enter into a contract to purchase electric energy at wholesale from an exempt wholesale generator that is an affiliate or associate company of the electric utility company—
(A) if every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail rates of such electric utility company makes each of the following specific determinations in advance of the electric utility company entering into such contract:
(i) A determination that such commission has sufficient regulatory authority, resources and access to books and records of the electric utility company and any relevant associate, affiliate or subsidiary company to exercise its duties under this subparagraph.
(ii) A determination that the transaction—
(I) will benefit consumers,
(II) does not violate any State law (including where applicable, least cost planning),
(III) would not provide the exempt wholesale generator any unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its affiliation or association with the electric utility company, and
(IV) is in the public interest; or
(B) if such electric utility company is not subject to State commission retail rate regulation and the purchased electric energy:
(i) would not be resold to any affiliate or associate company, or
(ii) the purchased electric energy would be resold to an affiliate or associate company and every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail rates of such affiliate or associate company makes each of the determinations provided under subparagraph (A), including the determination concerning a State commission's duties.

A foreign utility company shall be exempt from all of the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided under this section, and shall not, for any purpose under this chapter, be deemed to be a public utility company under section 79b(a)(5) of this title, notwithstanding that the foreign utility company may be a subsidiary company, an affiliate, or an associate company of a holding company or of a public utility company.

(2) State commission certification
Section 1 (a)(1) shall not apply or be effective unless every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail electric or gas rates of a public utility company that is an associate company or an affiliate of a company otherwise exempted under section 1 (a)(1) (other than a public utility company that is an associate company or an affiliate of a registered holding company) has certified to the Commission that it has the authority and resources to protect ratepayers subject to its jurisdiction and that it intends to exercise its authority. Such certification, upon the filing of a notice by such State commission, may be revised or withdrawn by the State commission prospectively as to any future acquisition. The requirement of State certification shall be deemed satisfied if the relevant State commission had, prior to October 24, 1992, on the basis of prescribed conditions of general applicability, determined that ratepayers of a public utility company are adequately insulated from the effects of diversification and the diversification would not impair the ability of the State commission to regulate effectively the operations of such company.
