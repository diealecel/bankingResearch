§631. Declaration of policy

(a) Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns
The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.

(b) Assistance to compete in international markets
(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Small Business Administration, acting in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by—
(A) enhancing their ability to export;
(B) facilitating technology transfers;
(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;
(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;
(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and
(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.
(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.

(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance
It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.

(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns
(1) The assistance programs authorized by sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.
(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title, the Congress finds—
(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;
(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;
(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;
(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.1
(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and
(vi) that the procurement authority under section 637(a) of this title shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.
(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title to—
(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and
(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.

(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs
Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.

(f) Findings; purpose
(1) with 2 respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds—
(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;
(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;
(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;
(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;
(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;
(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and
(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.
(2) It is therefore the purpose of section 637(a) of this title to—
(A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;
(B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement 3 assistance as may be necessary; and
(C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

(g) Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program
In administering the disaster loan program authorized by section 636 of this title, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.

(h) Assistance to women owned business
(1) With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that—
(A) women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;
(B) over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;
(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;
(D) such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;
(E) it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;
(F) the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;
(G) increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and
(H) programs and activities designed to assist small business concerns owned and controlled by women must be implemented in such a way as to remove such discriminatory barriers while not adversely affecting the rights of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
(2) It is, therefore, the purpose of those programs and activities conducted under the authority of this chapter that assist women entrepreneurs to—
(A) vigorously promote the legitimate interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;
(B) remove, insofar as possible, the discriminatory barriers that are encountered by women in accessing capital and other factors of production; and
(C) require that the Government engage in a systematic and sustained effort to identify, define and analyze those discriminatory barriers facing women and that such effort directly involve the participation of women business owners in the public/private sector partnership.

(i) Prohibition on use of funds for individuals not lawfully within United States
None of the funds made available pursuant to this chapter may be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to any individual in the United States if the Administrator or the official to which the funds are made available receives notification that the individual is not lawfully within the United States.

Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool.

(ii) with such assistance such concern has a reasonable prospect for operating soundly and profitably within a reasonable period of time;
(iii) the proceeds of such assistance will be used within a reasonable time for plant construction, conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or material or to supply such concern with working capital to be used in the manufacture of articles, equipment, supplies, or material for defense or civilian production or as may be necessary to insure a well-balanced national economy; and

(I) the closure (or substantial reduction) of a Department of Defense installation; or
(II) the termination (or substantial reduction) of a Department of Defense program on which such small business was a prime contractor or subcontractor (or supplier) at any tier; or
(ii) to a qualified individual seeking to establish (or acquire) and operate a small business concern.
(B) Recognizing that greater risk may be associated with a loan to a small business concern described in subparagraph (A)(i), any reasonable doubts concerning the firm's proposed business plan for transition to nondefense-related markets shall be resolved in favor of the loan applicant when making any determination regarding the sound value of the proposed loan in accordance with paragraph (6).

Except as to agricultural enterprises as defined in section 647(b)(1) of this title, the,4 Administration also is empowered to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts—
(1)(A) to make such loans (either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis) as the Administration may determine to be necessary or appropriate to repair, rehabilitate or replace property, real or personal, damaged or destroyed by or as a result of natural or other disasters: Provided, That such damage or destruction is not compensated for by insurance or otherwise: And provided further, That the Administration may increase the amount of the loan by up to an additional 20 per centum if it determines such increase to be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the damaged or destroyed property from possible future disasters by taking mitigating measures, including, but not limited to, construction of retaining walls and sea walls, grading and contouring land, relocating utilities and modifying structures;
(B) to refinance any mortgage or other lien against a totally destroyed or substantially damaged home or business concern: Provided, That no loan or guarantee shall be extended unless the Administration finds that (i) the applicant is not able to obtain credit elsewhere; (ii) such property is to be repaired, rehabilitated, or replaced; (iii) the amount refinanced shall not exceed the amount of physical loss sustained; and (iv) such amounts shall be reduced to the extent such mortgage or lien is satisfied by insurance or otherwise;
(2) to make such loans (either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis) as the Administration may determined to be necessary or appropriate to any small business concern or small agricultural cooperative located in an area affected by a disaster, if the Administration determines that the concern or the cooperative has suffered a substantial economic injury as a result of such disaster and if such disaster constitutes—
(A) a major disaster, as determined by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.]; or
(B) a natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961); or
(C) a disaster, as determined by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; or
(D) if no disaster declaration has been issued pursuant to subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the Governor of a State in which a disaster has occurred may certify to the Small Business Administration that small business concerns or small agricultural cooperatives (1) have suffered economic injury as a result of such disaster, and (2) are in need of financial assistance which is not available on reasonable terms in the disaster stricken area. Upon receipt of such certification, the Administration may then make such loans as would have been available under this paragraph if a disaster declaration had been issued.
Provided, That no loan or guarantee shall be extended pursuant to this paragraph (2) unless the Administration finds that the applicant is not able to obtain credit elsewhere.
No loan under this subsection, including renewals and extensions thereof, may be made for a period or periods exceeding thirty years: Provided, That the Administrator may consent to a suspension in the payment of principal and interest charges on, and to an extension in the maturity of, the Federal share of any loan under this subsection for a period not to exceed five years, if (A) the borrower under such loan is a homeowner or a small business concern, (B) the loan was made to enable (i) such homeowner to repair or replace his home, or (ii) such concern to repair or replace plant or equipment which was damaged or destroyed as the result of a disaster meeting the requirements of clause (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) of this subsection, and (C) the Administrator determines such action is necessary to avoid severe financial hardship: Provided further, That the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section shall not be applicable to any such loan having a maturity in excess of twenty years. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the interest rate on the Administration's share of any loan made under this subsection, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall not exceed the average annual interest rate on all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt as computed at the end of the fiscal year next preceding the date of the loan and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum plus one-quarter of 1 per centum: Provided, however, That the interest rate for loans made under paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof shall not exceed the rate of interest which is in effect at the time of the occurrence of the disaster. In agreements to participate in loans on a deferred basis under this subsection, such participation by the Administration shall not be in excess of 90 per centum of the balance of the loan outstanding at the time of disbursement. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the interest rate on the Administration's share of any loan made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection to repair or replace a primary residence and/or replace or repair damaged or destroyed personal property, less the amount of compensation by insurance or otherwise, with respect to a disaster occurring on or after July 1, 1976, and prior to October 1, 1978, shall be: 1 per centum on the amount of such loan not exceeding $10,000, and 3 per centum on the amount of such loan over $10,000 but not exceeding $40,000. The interest rate on the Administration's share of the first $250,000 of all other loans made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, with respect to a disaster occurring on or after July 1, 1976, and prior to October 1, 1978, shall be 3 per centum. All repayments of principal on the Administration's share of any loan made under the above provisions shall first be applied to reduce the principal sum of such loan which bears interest at the lower rates provided in this paragraph. The principal amount of any loan made pursuant to paragraph (1) in connection with a disaster which occurs on or after April 1, 1977, but prior to January 1, 1978, may be increased by such amount, but not more than $2,000, as the Administration determines to be reasonable in light of the amount and nature of loss, damage, or injury sustained in order to finance the installation of insulation in the property which was lost, damaged, or injured, if the uninsured, damaged portion of the property is 10 per centum or more of the market value of the property at the time of the disaster. Not later than June 1, 1978, the Administration shall prepare and transmit to the Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate, the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, and the Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives having jurisdiction over measures relating to energy conservation, a report on its activities under this paragraph, including therein an evaluation of the effect of such activities on encouraging the installation of insulation in property which is repaired or replaced after a disaster which is subject to this paragraph, and its recommendations with respect to the continuation, modification, or termination of such activities.

(C) may, in the case of a loan made under clause (A) or a mortgage or other lien refinanced under clause (B) in connection with the destruction of, or substantial damage to, property owned and used as a residence by an individual who by reason of retirement, disability, or other similar circumstances relies for support on survivor, disability, or retirement benefits under a pension, insurance, or other programs, consent to the suspension of the payments of the principal of that loan, mortgage, or lien during the lifetime of that individual and his spouse for so long as the Administration determines that making such payments would constitute a substantial hardship;
(D) shall notwithstanding the provisions of any other law and upon presentation by the applicant of proof of loss or damage or injury and a bona fide estimate of cost of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement, cancel the principal of any loan made to cover a loss or damage or injury resulting from such disaster, except that—
(i) with respect to a loan made in connection with a disaster occurring on or after January 1, 1971 but prior to January 1, 1972, the total amount so canceled shall not exceed $2,500, and the interest on the balance of the loan shall be at a rate of 3 per centum per annum; and

With respect to any loan referred to in clause (D) which is outstanding on August 16, 1972, the Administrator shall—
(i) make such change in the interest rate on the balance of such loan as is required under that clause effective as of August 16, 1972; and
(ii) in applying the limitation set forth in that clause with respect to the total amount of such loan which may be canceled, consider as part of the amount so canceled any part of such loan which was previously canceled pursuant to section 231 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 [15 U.S.C. 636a].

(2) During any period in which principal and interest charges are suspended on the Federal share of any loan, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall, upon the request of any person, firm, or corporation having a participation in such loan, purchase such participation, or assume the obligation of the borrower, for the balance of such period, to make principal and interest payments on the non-Federal share of such loan: Provided, That no such payments shall be made by the Administrator in behalf of any borrower unless (i) the Administrator determines that such action is necessary in order to avoid a default, and (ii) the borrower agrees to make payments to the Administration in an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid in its behalf by the Administrator, in such manner and at such times (during or after the term of the loan) as the Administrator shall determine having due regard to the purposes sought to be achieved by this paragraph.
(3) With respect to a disaster occurring on or after October 1, 1978, and prior 6 August 13, 1981, on the Administration's share of loans made pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section—
(A) if the loan proceeds are to repair or replace a primary residence and/or repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property, the interest rate shall be 3 percent on the first $55,000 of such loan;
(B) if the loan proceeds are to repair or replace property damaged or destroyed and if the applicant is a business concern which is unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere, the interest rate shall be as determined by the Administration, but not in excess of 5 percent per annum; and

All loans made under this subsection shall be of such sound value or so secured as reasonably to assure repayment: Provided, however, That any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of the applicant.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term “handicapped individual” means a person who has a physical, mental, or emotional impairment, defect, ailment, disease, or disability of a permanent nature which in any way limits the selection of any type of employment for which the person would otherwise be qualified or qualifiable.

(4) The Administration shall provide for the continuing evaluation of programs under this subsection, including full information on the location, income characteristics, and types of businesses and individuals assisted, and on new private lending activity stimulated, and the results of such evaluation together with recommendations shall be included in the report required by section 639(a) of this title.

(D)(i) Promptly after certification under paragraph (11) a Program Participant shall submit a business plan (hereinafter referred to as the “plan”) as described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph for review by the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned to assist such Program Participant. The plan may be a revision of a preliminary business plan submitted by the Program Participant or required by the Administration as a part of the application for certification under this section and shall be designed to result in the Program Participant eliminating the conditions or circumstances upon which the Administration determined eligibility pursuant to section 637(a)(6) of this title. Such plan, and subsequent modifications submitted under clause (iii) of this subparagraph, shall be approved by the business opportunity specialist prior to the Program Participant being eligible for award of a contract pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.
(ii) The plans submitted under this subparagraph shall include the following:
(I) An analysis of market potential, competitive environment, and other business analyses estimating the Program Participant's prospects for profitable operations during the term of program participation and after graduation.

The estimates established shall be consistent with the provisions of subparagraph (I) and section 637(a) of this title.
(iii) Each Program Participant shall annually review its currently approved plan with its Business Opportunity Specialist and modify such plan as may be appropriate. Any modified plan shall be submitted to the Administration for approval. The currently approved plan shall be considered valid until such time as a modified plan is approved by the Business Opportunity Specialist. Annual reviews pertaining to years in the transitional stage of program participation shall require, as appropriate, a written verification that such Program Participant has complied with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.
(iv) Each Program Participant shall annually forecast its needs for contract awards under section 637(a) of this title for the next program year and the succeeding program year during the review of its business plan, conducted pursuant to clause (iii). Such forecast shall be known as the section 8(a) [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] contract support level and shall be included in the Program Participant's business plan. Such forecast shall include—
(I) the aggregate dollar value of contract support to be sought on a noncompetitive basis under section 637(a) of this title, reflecting compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title,
(II) the types of contract opportunities being sought, identified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or otherwise,
(III) an estimate of the dollar value of contract support to be sought on a competitive basis, and
(IV) such other information as may be requested by the Business Opportunity Specialist to provide effective business development assistance to the Program Participant.
(E) A small business concern participating in the program conducted under the authority of this paragraph and eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title shall be denied all such assistance if such concern—
(i) voluntarily elects not to continue participation;
(ii) completes the period of Program participation as prescribed by paragraph (15);
(iii) is terminated pursuant to a termination proceeding conducted in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title; or
(iv) is graduated pursuant to a graduation proceeding conducted in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title.
(F) For purposes of this section and section 637(a) of this title, the term “terminated” and the term “termination” means the total denial or suspension of assistance under this paragraph or under section 637(a) of this title prior to the graduation of the participating small business concern or prior to the expiration of the maximum program participation term. An action for termination shall be based upon good cause, including—
(i) the failure by such concern to maintain its eligibility for Program participation;
(ii) the failure of the concern to engage in business practices that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of unjustified delinquent performance or terminations for default with respect to contracts awarded under the authority of section 637(a) of this title;
(iii) a demonstrated pattern of failing to make required submissions or responses to the Administration in a timely manner;
(iv) the willful violation of any rule or regulation of the Administration pertaining to material issues;

For purposes of this clause, no termination action shall be taken with respect to a disadvantaged owner solely because of the conviction of an officer of the concern (who is other than a disadvantaged owner) unless such owner conspired with, abetted, or otherwise knowingly acquiesced in the activity or omission that was the basis of such officer's conviction.
(G) The Director of the Division may initiate a termination proceeding by recommending such action to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. Whenever the Associate Administrator, or a designee of such officer, determines such termination is appropriate, within 15 days after making such a determination the Program Participant shall be provided a written notice of intent to terminate, specifying the reasons for such action. No Program Participant shall be terminated from the Program pursuant to subparagraph (F) without first being afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title.
(H) For the purposes of this subsection and section 637(a) of this title the term “graduated” or “graduation” means that the Program Participant is recognized as successfully completing the program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives, and goals contained in the concern's business plan thereby demonstrating its ability to compete in the marketplace without assistance under this section or section 637(a) of this title.
(I)(i) During the developmental stage of its participation in the Program, a Program Participant shall take all reasonable efforts within its control to attain the targets contained in its business plan for contracts awarded other than pursuant to section 637(a) of this title (hereinafter referred to as “business activity targets.”). Such efforts shall be made a part of the business plan and shall be sufficient in scope and duration to satisfy the Administration that the Program Participant will engage a reasonable marketing strategy that will maximize its potential to achieve its business activity targets.
(ii) During the transitional stage of the Program a Program Participant shall be subject to regulations regarding business activity targets that are promulgated by the Administration pursuant to clause (iii);
(iii) The regulations referred to in clause (ii) shall:
(I) establish business activity targets applicable to Program Participants during the fifth year and each succeeding year of Program Participation; such targets, for such period of time, shall reflect a reasonably consistent increase in contracts awarded other than pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, expressed as a percentage of total sales; when promulgating business activity targets the Administration may establish modified targets for Program Participants that have participated in the Program for a period of longer than four years on June 1, 1989;
(II) require a Program Participant to attain its business activity targets;
(III) provide that, before the receipt of any contract to be awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, the Program Participant (if it is in the transitional stage) must certify that it has complied with the regulations promulgated pursuant to subclause (II), or that it is in compliance with such remedial measures as may have been ordered pursuant to regulations issued under subclause (V);
(IV) require the Administration to review each Program Participant's performance regarding attainment of business activity targets during periodic reviews of such Participant's business plan; and
(V) authorize the Administration to take appropriate remedial measures with respect to a Program Participant that has failed to attain a required business activity target for the purpose of reducing such Participant's dependence on contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; such remedial actions may include, but are not limited to assisting the Program Participant to expand the dollar volume of its competitive business activity or limiting the dollar volume of contracts awarded to the Program Participant pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; except for actions that would constitute a termination, remedial measures taken pursuant to this subclause shall not be reviewable pursuant to section 637(a)(9) of this title.
(J)(i) The Administration shall conduct an evaluation of a Program Participant's eligibility for continued participation in the Program whenever it receives specific and credible information alleging that such Program Participant no longer meets the requirements for Program eligibility. Upon making a finding that a Program Participant is no longer eligible, the Administration shall initiate a termination proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (F). A Program Participant's eligibility for award of any contract under the authority of section 637(a) of this title may be suspended pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).
(ii)(I) Except as authorized by subclauses (II) or (III), no award shall be made pursuant to section 637(a) of this title to a concern other than a small business concern.
(II) In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), each firm's size shall be independently determined without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.
(III) Any joint venture established under the authority of section 602(b) of Public Law 100–656, the “Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988”, shall be eligible for award of a contract pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.
(11)(A) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development shall be responsible for coordinating and formulating policies relating to Federal assistance to small business concerns eligible for assistance under subsection (i) of this section and small business concerns eligible to receive contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.
(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (iii), no individual who was determined pursuant to section 637(a) of this title to be socially and economically disadvantaged before August 15, 1989, shall be permitted to assert such disadvantage with respect to any other concern making application for certification after August 15, 1989.
(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), any individual upon whom eligibility is based pursuant to section 637(a)(4) of this title shall be permitted to assert such eligibility for only one small business concern.
(iii) A socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe may own more than one small business concern eligible for assistance pursuant to paragraph (10) and section 637(a) of this title if—
(I) the Indian tribe does not own another firm in the same industry which has been determined to be eligible to receive contracts under this program, and
(II) the individuals responsible for the management and daily operations of the concern do not manage more than two Program Participants.
(C) No concern, previously eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, shall be subsequently recertified for program participation if its prior participation in the program was concluded for any of the reasons described in paragraph (10)(E).
(D) A concern eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection shall remain eligible for such contracts if there is a transfer of ownership and control (as defined pursuant to section 637(a)(4) of this title) to individuals who are determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged pursuant to section 637(a) of this title. In the event of such a transfer, the concern, if not terminated or graduated, shall be eligible for a period of continued participation in the program not to exceed the time limitations prescribed in paragraph (15).
(E) There is established a Division of Program Certification and Eligibility (hereinafter referred to in this paragraph as the “Division”) that shall be made part of the Office of Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. The Division shall be headed by a Director who shall report directly to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. The Division shall establish field offices within such regional offices of the Administration as may be necessary to perform efficiently its functions and responsibilities.
(F) Subject to the provisions of section 637(a)(9) of this title, the functions and responsibility of the Division are to—

(i) the Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or
(ii) the purchases of such products or services by the Federal Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other Program Participants providing the same or similar items or services.

The review shall ascertain the number of entrants, their geographic distribution and industrial classification. The Director shall also estimate the expected growth of the Program during the next fiscal year and the number of additional Business Opportunity Specialists, if any, that will be needed to meet the anticipated demand for the Program.

When considering such increase the Administration shall give due consideration to those industrial categories where Federal purchases have been substantial but where the participation rate of such concerns has been limited.
(12)(A) The Administration shall segment the Capital Ownership Development Program into two stages: a developmental stage; and a transitional stage.
(B) The developmental stage of program participation shall be designed to assist the concern in its effort to overcome its economic disadvantage by providing such assistance as may be necessary and appropriate to access its markets and to strengthen its financial and managerial skills.

(1) It shall be the duty of the Administration and it is hereby empowered, whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate—
(A) to enter into contracts with the United States Government and any department, agency, or officer thereof having procurement powers obligating the Administration to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to the Government or to perform construction work for the Government. In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer's adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer's adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator's request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator's request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the department or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;
(B) to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;
(C) to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by section 636(j)(15) of this title, if—
(i) the contract will be awarded as a result of an offer (including price) submitted in response to a published solicitation relating to a competition conducted pursuant to subparagraph (D); and
(ii) the prospective contract awardee was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation; and
(D)(i) A contract opportunity offered for award pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded on the basis of competition restricted to eligible Program Participants if—
(I) there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible Program Participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price, and
(II) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $5,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.
(ii) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, on a nondelegable basis, is authorized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.
(2) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of section 270a of title 40, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: Provided, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if—
(A) the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;
(B) the Administration assists, insofar as practicable, a small business receiving the benefits of this paragraph to develop, within a reasonable period of time, such financial and other capability as may be needed to obtain such bonds as the Administration may subsequently require for the successful completion of any program conducted under the authority of this subsection;
(C) the Administration finds that such small business is unable to obtain the requisite bond or bonds from a surety and that no surety is willing to issue bond or bonds subject to the guarantee provisions of Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 692 et seq.]; and
(D) the small business is determined to be a start-up concern and such concern has not been participating in any program conducted under the authority of this subsection for a period exceeding one year.
The authority to waive bonds provided in this paragraph (2) may not be exercised after September 30, 1988.
(3)(A) Any Program Participant selected by the Administration to perform a contract to be let noncompetitively pursuant to this subsection shall, when practicable, participate in any negotiation of the terms and conditions of such contract.
(B)(i) For purposes of paragraph (1) a “fair market price” shall be determined by the agency offering the procurement requirement to the Administration, in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).
(ii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.
(iii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.
(C) An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair market price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency. The agency's estimate of the current fair market price (and any supporting data furnished to the Administration) shall not be disclosed to any potential offeror (other than the Administration).
(D) A small business concern selected by the Administration to perform or negotiate a contract to be let pursuant to this subsection may request the Administration to protest the agency's estimate of the fair market price for such contract pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).
(4)(A) For purposes of this section, the term “socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern” means any small business concern which meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) and—
(i) which is at least 51 per centum unconditionally owned by—
(I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,
(II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), or
(III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization, or
(ii) in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is unconditionally owned by—
(I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,
(II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), or
(III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization.
(B) A small business concern meets the requirements of this subparagraph if the management and daily business operations of such small business concern are controlled by one or more—
(i) socially and economically disadvantaged individuals described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(I),
(ii) members of an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe described in subparagraph (A)(i)(II) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), or
(iii) Native Hawaiian organizations described in subparagraph (A)(i)(III) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(III).
(C) Each Program Participant shall certify, on an annual basis, that it meets the requirements of this paragraph regarding ownership and control.
(5) Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.
(6)(A) Economically disadvantaged individuals are those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged. In determining the degree of diminished credit and capital opportunities the Administration shall consider, but not be limited to, the assets and net worth of such socially disadvantaged individual. In determining the economic disadvantage of an Indian tribe, the Administration shall consider, where available, information such as the following: the per capita income of members of the tribe excluding judgment awards, the percentage of the local Indian population below the poverty level, and the tribe's access to capital markets.
(B) Each Program Participant shall annually submit to the Administration—
(i) a personal financial statement for each disadvantaged owner;
(ii) a record of all payments made by the Program Participant to each of its disadvantaged owners or to any person or entity affiliated with such owners; and
(iii) such other information as the Administration may deem necessary to make the determinations required by this paragraph.
(C)(i) Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the standards to establish economic disadvantage pursuant to subparagraph (A) have not been met, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners continue to be impaired in their ability to compete in the free enterprise system due to diminished capital and credit opportunities when compared to other concerns in the same business area, which are not socially disadvantaged.
(ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that a Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners are no longer economically disadvantaged for the purpose of receiving assistance under this subsection, the Program Participant shall be graduated pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title subject to the right to a hearing as provided for under paragraph (9).
(D)(i) Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the amount of funds or other assets withdrawn from a Program Participant for the personal benefit of its disadvantaged owners or any person or entity affiliated with such owners may have been unduly excessive, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such withdrawal of funds or other assets was detrimental to the achievement of the targets, objectives, and goals contained in such Program Participant's business plan.
(ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that funds or other assets have been withdrawn to the detriment of the Program Participant's business, the Administration shall—
(I) initiate a proceeding to terminate the Program Participant pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(F) of this title, subject to the right to a hearing under paragraph (9); or
(II) require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other steps as the Administration may deem necessary to ensure the protection of the concern.
(E) Whenever the Administration computes personal net worth for any purpose under this paragraph, it shall exclude from such computation—
(i) the value of investments that disadvantaged owners have in their concerns, except that such value shall be taken into account under this paragraph when comparing such concerns to other concerns in the same business area that are owned by other than socially disadvantaged persons;
(ii) the equity that disadvantaged owners have in their primary personal residences, except that any portion of such equity that is attributable to unduly excessive withdrawals from a Program Participant or a concern applying for program participation shall be taken into account.
(7)(A) No small business concern shall be deemed eligible for any assistance pursuant to this subsection unless the Administration determines that with contract, financial, technical, and management support the small business concern will be able to perform contracts which may be awarded to such concern under paragraph (1)(C) and has reasonable prospects for success in competing in the private sector.
(B) Limitations established by the Administration in its regulations and procedures restricting the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection to a limited number of standard industrial classification codes in an approved business plan shall not be applied in a manner that inhibits the logical business progression by a participating small business concern into areas of industrial endeavor where such concern has the potential for success.
(8) All determinations made pursuant to paragraph (5) with respect to whether a group has been subjected to prejudice or bias shall be made by the Administrator after consultation with the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. All other determinations made pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7) shall be made by the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development under the supervision of, and responsible to, the Administrator.
(9)(A) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (E), the Administration, prior to taking any action described in subparagraph (B), shall provide the small business concern that is the subject of such action, an opportunity for a hearing on the record, in accordance with chapter 5 of title 5.
(B) The actions referred to in subparagraph (A) are—
(i) denial of program admission based upon a negative determination pursuant to paragraph (4), (5), or (6);
(ii) a termination pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(F) of this title;
(iii) a graduation pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title; and
(iv) the denial of a request to issue a waiver pursuant to paragraph (21)(B).
(C) The Administration's proposed action, in any proceeding conducted under the authority of this paragraph, shall be sustained unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
(D) A decision rendered pursuant to this paragraph shall be the final decision of the Administration and shall be binding upon the Administration and those within its employ.
(E) The adjudicator selected to preside over a proceeding conducted under the authority of this paragraph shall decline to accept jurisdiction over any matter that—
(i) does not, on its face, allege facts that, if proven to be true, would warrant reversal or modification of the Administration's position;
(ii) is untimely filed;
(iii) is not filed in accordance with the rules of procedure governing such proceedings; or
(iv) has been decided by or is the subject of an adjudication before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters.
(F) Proceedings conducted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall be completed and a decision rendered, insofar as practicable, within ninety days after a petition for a hearing is filed with the adjudicating office.
(10) The Administration shall develop and implement an outreach program to inform and recruit small business concerns to apply for eligibility for assistance under this subsection. Such program shall make a sustained and substantial effort to solicit applications for certification from small business concerns located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas and within States having relatively few Program Participants and from small disadvantaged business concerns in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the authority of this subsection.
(11) To the maximum extent practicable, construction subcontracts awarded by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.
(12)(A) The Administration shall require each concern eligible to receive subcontracts pursuant to this subsection to annually prepare and submit to the Administration a capability statement. Such statement shall briefly describe such concern's various contract performance capabilities and shall contain the name and telephone number of the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned such concern. The Administration shall separate such statements by those primarily dependent upon local contract support and those primarily requiring a national marketing effort. Statements primarily dependent upon local contract support shall be disseminated to appropriate buying activities in the marketing area of the concern. The remaining statements shall be disseminated to the Directors of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization for the appropriate agencies who shall further distribute such statements to buying activities with such agencies that may purchase the types of items or services described on the capability statements.
(B) Contracting activities receiving capability statements shall, within 60 days after receipt, contact the relevant Business Opportunity Specialist to indicate the number, type, and approximate dollar value of contract opportunities that such activities may be awarding over the succeeding 12-month period and which may be appropriate to consider for award to those concerns for which it has received capability statements.
(C) Each executive agency reporting to the Federal Procurement Data System contract actions with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000,000 in fiscal year 1988, or in any succeeding fiscal year, shall prepare a forecast of expected contract opportunities or classes of contract opportunities for the next and succeeding fiscal years that small business concerns, including those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, are capable of performing. Such forecast shall be periodically revised during such year. To the extent such information is available, the agency forecasts shall specify:
(i) The approximate number of individual contract opportunities (and the number of opportunities within a class).
(ii) The approximate dollar value, or range of dollar values, for each contract opportunity or class of contract opportunities.
(iii) The anticipated time (by fiscal year quarter) for the issuance of a procurement request.
(iv) The activity responsible for the award and administration of the contract.
(D) The head of each executive agency subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall within 10 days of completion furnish such forecasts to—
(i) the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization established pursuant to section 644(k) of this title for such agency; and
(ii) the Administrator.
(E) The information reported pursuant to subparagraph (D) may be limited to classes of items and services for which there are substantial annual purchases.

(A) is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, or
(B) is recognized as such by the State in which such tribe, band, nation, group, or community resides.
(14)(A) A concern may not be awarded a contract under this subsection as a small business concern unless the concern agrees that—
(i) in the case of a contract for services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern; and
(ii) in the case of a contract for procurement of supplies (other than procurement from a regular dealer in such supplies), the concern will perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials).
(B) The Administrator may change the percentage under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines that such change is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry category. A percentage established under the preceding sentence may not differ from a percentage established under section 644(o) of this title.
(C) The Administration shall establish, through public rulemaking, requirements similar to those specified in subparagraph (A) to be applicable to contracts for general and specialty construction and to contracts for any other industry category not otherwise subject to the requirements of such subparagraph. The percentage applicable to any such requirement shall be determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), except that such a percentage may not differ from a percentage established under section 644(o) of this title for the same industry category.
(15) For purposes of this subsection, the term “Native Hawaiian Organization” means any community service organization serving Native Hawaiians in the State of Hawaii which—

(17)(A) An otherwise responsible business concern that is in compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (B) shall not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered its offer for any procurement contract for the supply of a product to be let pursuant to this subsection or subsection (a) of section 644 of this title solely because such concern is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product to be supplied under the contract.
(B) To be in compliance with the requirements referred to in subparagraph (A), such a business concern shall—
(i) be primarily engaged in the wholesale or retail trade;
(ii) be a small business concern under the numerical size standard for the Standard Industrial Classification Code assigned to the contract solicitation on which the offer is being made;
(iii) be a regular dealer, as defined pursuant to section 35(a) of title 41 (popularly referred to as the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act), in the product to be offered the Government or be specifically exempted from such section by section 636(j)(13)(C) of this title; and
(iv) represent that it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver of such requirement is granted—

(II) by the Administrator for a product (or class of products), after determining that no small business manufacturer or processor is available to participate in the Federal procurement market.

(B) To establish, conduct, and publicize, and to recruit, select, and train volunteers for (and to enter into contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements therefor), volunteer programs, including a Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) and an Active Corps of Executive (ACE) for the purposes of subparagraph (A); and to facilitate the implementation of such volunteer programs the Administration may maintain at its headquarters and pay the expenses of a team of volunteers subject to such conditions and limitations as the Administration deems appropriate: Provided, That any such payments made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

(3) to coordinate and to ascertain the means by which the productive capacity of small-business concerns can be most effectively utilized;
(4) to consult and cooperate with officers of the Government having procurement or property disposal powers, in order to utilize the potential productive capacity of plants operated by small-business concerns;

(6) to determine within any industry the concerns, firms, persons, corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, or other business enterprises which are to be designated “small-business concerns” for the purpose of effectuating the provisions of this chapter. To carry out this purpose the Administrator, when requested to do so, shall issue in response to each such request an appropriate certificate certifying an individual concern as a “small-business concern” in accordance with the criteria expressed in this chapter. Any such certificate shall be subject to revocation when the concern covered thereby ceases to be a “small-business concern”. Offices of the Government having procurement or lending powers, or engaging in the disposal of Federal property or allocating materials or supplies, or promulgating regulations affecting the distribution of materials or supplies, shall accept as conclusive the Administration's determination as to which enterprises are to be designated “small-business concerns”, as authorized and directed under this paragraph;

A Government procurement officer or an officer engaged in the sale and disposal of Federal property may not, for any reason specified in the preceding sentence preclude any small business concern or group of such concerns from being awarded such contract without referring the matter for a final disposition to the Administration.
(B) If a Government procurement officer finds that an otherwise qualified small business concern may be ineligible due to the provisions of section 35(a) of title 41, he shall notify the Administration in writing of such finding. The Administration shall review such finding and shall either dismiss it and certify the small business concern to be an eligible Government contractor for a specific Government contract or if it concurs in the finding, forward the matter to the Secretary of Labor for final disposition, in which case the Administration may certify the small business concern only if the Secretary of Labor finds the small business concern not to be in violation.
(C) In any case in which a small business concern or group of such concerns has been certified by the Administration pursuant to (A) or (B) to be a responsible or eligible Government contractor as to a specific Government contract, the officers of the Government having procurement or property disposal powers are directed to accept such certification as conclusive, and shall let such Government contract to such concern or group of concerns without requiring it to meet any other requirement of responsibility or eligibility. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, the Administration may not establish an exemption from referral or notification or refuse to accept a referral or notification from a Government procurement officer made pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, but nothing in this paragraph shall require the processing of an application for certification if the small business concern to which the referral pertains declines to have the application processed.
(8) to obtain from any Federal department, establishment, or agency engaged in procurement or in the financing of procurement or production such reports concerning the letting of contracts and subcontracts and the making of loans to business concerns as it may deem pertinent in carrying out its functions under this chapter;
(9) to obtain from any Federal department, establishment, or agency engaged in the disposal of Federal property such reports concerning the solicitation of bids, time of sale, or otherwise as it may deem pertinent in carrying out its functions under this chapter;

(12) to consult and cooperate with all Government agencies for the purpose of insuring that small-business concerns shall receive fair and reasonable treatment from such agencies;
(13) to establish such advisory boards and committees as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter and of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]; to call meetings of such boards and committees from time to time; to pay the transportation expenses and a per diem allowance in accordance with section 5703 of title 5 to the members of such boards and committees for travel and subsistence expenses incurred at the request of the Administration in connection with travel to points more than fifty miles distant from the homes of such members in attending the meeting of such boards and committees; and to rent temporarily, within the District of Columbia or elsewhere, such hotel or other accommodations as are needed to facilitate the conduct of such meetings;
(14) to provide at the earliest practicable time such information and assistance as may be appropriate, including information concerning eligibility for loans under section 636(b)(3) of this title, to local public agencies (as defined in section 110(h) of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1460(h)]) and to small-business concerns to be displaced by federally aided urban renewal projects in order to assist such small-business concerns in reestablishing their operations;

§638. Research and development

(a) Declaration of policy
Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.

(b) Assistance to small-business concerns
It shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—
(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;
(2) to assist small-business concerns to obtain the benefits of research and development performed under Government contracts or at Government expense;
(3) to provide technical assistance to small-business concerns to accomplish the purposes of this section; and 1
(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer pilot programs;
(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses’ opportunities to respond to solicitations;
(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies; and
(7) to report not less than annually to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives on the SBIR and STTR programs of the Federal agencies and the Administration's information and monitoring efforts related to the SBIR and STTR programs.

(c) Consultation and cooperation with Government agencies; studies and recommendations
The Administration is authorized to consult and cooperate with all Government agencies and to make studies and recommendations to such agencies, and such agencies are authorized and directed to cooperate with the Administration in order to carry out and to accomplish the purposes of this section.

(d) Joint programs; approval of agreements; withdrawal of approval; publication in Federal Register
(1) The Administrator is authorized to consult with representatives of small-business concerns with a view to assisting and encouraging such firms to undertake joint programs for research and development carried out through such corporate or other mechanism as may be most appropriate for the purpose. Such joint programs may, among other things, include the following purposes:
(A) to construct, acquire, or establish laboratories and other facilities for the conduct of research;
(B) to undertake and utilize applied research;
(C) to collect research information related to a particular industry and disseminate it to participating members;
(D) to conduct applied research on a protected, proprietary, and contractual basis with member or nonmember firms, Government agencies, and others;
(E) to prosecute applications for patents and render patent services for participating members; and
(F) to negotiate and grant licenses under patents held under the joint program, and to establish corporations designed to exploit particular patents obtained by it.
(2) The Administrator may, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and with the prior written approval of the Attorney General, approve any agreement between small-business firms providing for a joint program of research and development, if the Administrator finds that the joint program proposed will maintain and strengthen the free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. The Administrator or the Attorney General may at any time withdraw his approval of the agreement and the joint program of research and development covered thereby, if he finds that the agreement or the joint program carried on under it is no longer in the best interests of the competitive free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. A copy of the statement of any such finding and approval intended to be within the coverage of this subsection, and a copy of any modification or withdrawal of approval, shall be published in the Federal Register. The authority conferred by this subsection on the Administrator shall not be delegated by him.
(3) No act or omission to act pursuant to and within the scope of any joint program for research and development, under an agreement approved by the Administrator under this subsection, shall be construed to be within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.]. Upon publication in the Federal Register of the notice of withdrawal of his approval of the agreement granted under this subsection, either by the Administrator or by the Attorney General, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any subsequent act or omission to act by reason of such agreement or approval.

§641. Transfer to Administration of other functions, powers, and duties
The President may transfer to the Administration any functions, powers, and duties of any department or agency which relate primarily to small-business problems. In connection with any such transfer, the President may provide for appropriate transfers of records, property, necessary personnel, and unexpended balances of appropriations and other funds available to the department or agency from which the transfer is made.

§642. Requirements for loans
No loan shall be made or equipment, facilities, or services furnished by the Administration under this chapter to any business enterprise unless the owners, partners, or officers of such business enterprise (1) certify to the Administration the names of any attorneys, agents, or other persons engaged by or on behalf of such business enterprise for the purpose of expediting applications made to the Administration for assistance of any sort, and the fees paid or to be paid to any such persons; (2) execute an agreement binding any such business enterprise for a period of two years after any assistance is rendered by the Administration to such business enterprise, to refrain from employing, tendering any office or employment to, or retaining for professional services, any person who, on the date such assistance or any part thereof was rendered, or within one year prior thereto, shall have served as an officer, attorney, agent, or employee of the Administration occupying a position or engaging in activities which the Administration shall have determined involve discretion with respect to the granting of assistance under this chapter; and (3) furnish the names of lending institutions to which such business enterprise has applied for loans together with dates, amounts, terms, and proof of refusal.

§643. Fair charge for use of Government-owned property
To the fullest extent the Administration deems practicable, it shall make a fair charge for the use of Government-owned property and make and let contracts on a basis that will result in a recovery of the direct costs incurred by the Administration.

§644. Awards or contracts

(a) Determination
To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, or (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the four-digit standard industrial classification codes contained in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.

(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency
With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.

(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals
(1) As used in this subsection:
(A) The term “Committee” means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under section 46 of title 41.
(B) The term “public or private organization for the handicapped” has the same meaning given such term in section 632(e) of this title.
(C) The term “handicapped individual” has the same meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this title.
(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.
(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 47 of title 41.
(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.
(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.
(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.
(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.
(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.
(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.

(d) Priority
For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.

(e), (f) Repealed. Pub. L. 103–355, title VII, §7101(a), Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3367

(g) Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts
(1) The President shall annually establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 20 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.
(2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns,,1 by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make consistent efforts to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts of the agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain such participation, shall consider—
(A) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and
(B) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eligible small business concerns under this section and under the program established under section 637(a) of this title.

(h) Reports to Administration; submittal of information to Congress
(1) At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall report to the Administration on the extent of participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Such reports shall contain appropriate justifications for failure to meet the goals established under subsection (g) of this section.
(2) The Administration shall annually compile and analyze the reports submitted by the individual agencies pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall submit them to the President. The Administration's submission to the President shall include the following:
(A) The Government-wide goals for participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women and the performance in attaining such goals.
(B) The goals in effect for each agency and the agency's performance in attaining such goals.
(C) An analysis of any failure to achieve the Government-wide goals or any individual agency goals and the actions planned by such agency (and approved by the Administration) to achieve the goals in the succeeding fiscal year.
(D) The number and dollar value of contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women through—
(i) noncompetitive negotiation,
(ii) competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,
(iii) competition restricted to small business concerns, and
(iv) unrestricted competitions,
for each agency and on a Government-wide basis.
(E) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.
(F) The number and dollar value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by women.
(3) The President shall include the information required by paragraph (2) in each annual report to the Congress on the state of small business prepared pursuant to section 631b(a) of this title.

(i) Small business set-asides
Nothing in this chapter or any other provision of law precludes exclusive small business set-asides for procurements of architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation, and each Federal agency is authorized to develop such set-asides to further the interests of small business in those areas.

(j) Small business reservation
(1) Each contract for the purchase of goods and services that has an anticipated value greater than $2,500 but not greater than $100,000 shall be reserved exclusively for small business concerns unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive with market prices and are competitive with regard to the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased.
(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a contracting officer shall consider a responsive offer timely received from an eligible small business offeror.
(3) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as precluding an award of a contract with a value not greater than $100,000 under the authority of subsection (a) of section 637 of this title, section 2323 of title 10, section 712 of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (Public Law 100–656; 15 U.S.C. 644 note), or section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.

(9) make recommendations to contracting officers as to whether a particular contract requirement should be awarded pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or section 637(a) of this title or section 2323 of title 10. Such recommendations shall be made with due regard to the requirements of subsection (m) of this section, and the failure of the contracting officer to accept any such recommendations shall be documented and included within the appropriate contract file.
This subsection shall not apply to the Administration.

(l) Breakout procurement center representatives
(1) The Administration shall assign to each major procurement center a breakout procurement center representative with such assistance as may be appropriate. The breakout procurement center representative shall carry out the activities described in paragraph (2), and shall be an advocate for the breakout of items for procurement through full and open competition, whenever appropriate, while maintaining the integrity of the system in which such items are used, and an advocate for the use of full and open competition, whenever appropriate, for the procurement of supplies and services by such center.

(B) review, at any time, restrictions on competition previously imposed on items through acquisition method coding or similar procedures, and recommend to personnel of the appropriate activity the prompt reevaluation of such limitations;
(C) review restrictions on competition arising out of restrictions on the rights of the United States in technical data, and, when appropriate, recommend that personnel of the appropriate activity initiate a review of the validity of such an asserted restriction;
(D) obtain from any governmental source, and make available to personnel of the appropriate activity, technical data necessary for the preparation of a competitive solicitation package for any item of supply or service previously procured noncompetitively due to the unavailability of such technical data;
(E) have access to procurement records and other data of the procurement center commensurate with the level of such representative's approved security clearance classification;
(F) receive unsolicited engineering proposals and, when appropriate (i) conduct a value analysis of such proposal to determine whether such proposal, if adopted, will result in lower costs to the United States without substantially impeding legitimate acquisition objectives and forward to personnel of the appropriate activity recommendations with respect to such proposal, or (ii) forward such proposals without analysis to personnel of the activity responsible for reviewing such proposals and who shall furnish the breakout procurement center representative with information regarding the disposition of any such proposal; and
(G) review the systems that account for the acquisition and management of technical data within the procurement center to assure that such systems provide the maximum availability and access to data needed for the preparation of offers to sell to the United States those supplies to which such data pertain which potential offerors are entitled to receive.
(3) A breakout procurement center representative is authorized to appeal the failure to act favorably on any recommendation made pursuant to paragraph (2). Such appeal shall be filed and processed in the same manner and subject to the same conditions and limitations as an appeal filed by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term “major procurement center” means a procurement center that, in the opinion of the Administrator, purchases substantial dollar amounts of other than commercial items and which has the potential to incur significant savings as the result of the placement of a breakout procurement center representative.
(7)(A) At such times as the Administrator deems appropriate, the breakout procurement center representative shall conduct familiarization sessions for contracting officers and other appropriate personnel of the procurement center to which such representative is assigned. Such sessions shall acquaint the participants with the provisions of this subsection and shall instruct them in methods designed to further the purposes of such subsection.
(B) The breakout procurement center representative shall prepare and personally deliver an annual briefing and report to the head of the procurement center to which such representative is assigned. Such briefing and report shall detail the past and planned activities of the representative and shall contain such recommendations for improvement in the operation of the center as may be appropriate. The head of such center shall personally receive such briefing and report and shall, within sixty calendar days after receipt, respond, in writing, to each recommendation made by such representative.

Such determination, as modified by the preceding sentence, shall be made by the Secretary of Labor.

(o) Requirements for performance of contracts by employees of small business concerns
(1) A concern may not be awarded a contract under subsection (a) of this section as a small business concern unless the concern agrees that—
(A) in the case of a contract for services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern;
(B) in the case of a contract for procurement of supplies (other than procurement from a regular dealer in such supplies), the concern will perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials).

§647. Duplication of activities of other Federal departments or agencies

(a) General prohibition; exception

The Administration shall require any applicant for a small business development center grant with performance commencing on or after January 1, 1992 to have its own budget and to primarily utilize institutions of higher education to provide services to the small business community. The term of such grants shall be made on a calendar year basis or to coincide with the Federal fiscal year.
(2) The Small Business Development Centers shall work in close cooperation with the Administration's regional and local offices, the Department of Commerce, appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and the small business community to serve as an active information dissemination and service delivery mechanism for existing trade promotion, trade finance, trade adjustment, trade remedy and trade data collection programs of particular utility for small businesses.
(3) The Small Business Development Center Program shall be under the general management and oversight of the Administration, but with recognition that a partnership exists under this section between the Administration and the applicant for the delivery of assistance to the small business community.
