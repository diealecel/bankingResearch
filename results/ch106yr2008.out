§8001. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Of injury-related deaths, drowning is the second leading cause of death in children aged 1 to 14 in the United States.
(2) In 2004, 761 children aged 14 and under died as a result of unintentional drowning.
(3) Adult supervision at all aquatic venues is a critical safety factor in preventing children from drowning.
