§2001. Congressional declaration of policy and objectives
(a) It is declared to be the policy of the Congress, recognizing that a prosperous, productive agriculture is essential to a free nation and recognizing the growing need for credit in rural areas, that the farmer-owned cooperative Farm Credit System be designed to accomplish the objective of improving the income and well-being of American farmers and ranchers by furnishing sound, adequate, and constructive credit and closely related services to them, their cooperatives, and to selected farm-related businesses necessary for efficient farm operations.
(b) It is the objective of this chapter to continue to encourage farmer- and rancher-borrowers participation in the management, control, and ownership of a permanent system of credit for agriculture which will be responsive to the credit needs of all types of agricultural producers having a basis for credit, and to modernize and improve the authorizations and means for furnishing such credit and credit for housing in rural areas made available through the institutions constituting the Farm Credit System as herein provided.
(c) It is declared to be the policy of Congress that the credit needs of farmers, ranchers, and their cooperatives are best served if the institutions of the Farm Credit System provide equitable and competitive interest rates to eligible borrowers, taking into consideration the creditworthiness and access to alternative sources of credit for borrowers, the cost of funds, including any costs of defeasance under section 2159(b) of this title, the operating costs of the institution, including the costs of any loan loss amortization under section 2254(b) of this title, the cost of servicing loans, the need to retain earnings to protect borrowers’ stock, and the volume of net new borrowing. Further, it is declared to be the policy of Congress that Farm Credit System institutions take action in accordance with the Farm Credit Act Amendments of 1986 in such manner that borrowers from the institutions derive the greatest benefit practicable from that Act: Provided, That in no case is any borrower to be charged a rate of interest that is below competitive market rates for similar loans made by private lenders to borrowers of equivalent creditworthiness and access to alternative credit.

(II) are not guaranteed or insured, in an amount equal to at least 95 percent of the amount loaned, by a department, agency, bureau, board, commission, or establishment of the United States or a corporation wholly-owned directly or indirectly by the United States,
exceeds an amount that is equal to 50 percent of the bank's capital, then a sufficient interest in the loans shall be sold by the bank for cooperatives to commercial banks and other non-System lenders to reduce the total amount of such outstanding balances to an amount not greater than an amount equal to 50 percent of the bank's capital; and
(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (B), any domestic or foreign party in which an eligible cooperative association described in section 2129(a) of this title (including, for the purpose of facilitating its domestic business operations only, a cooperative or other entity described in section 2129(b)(1)(A) of this title) has an ownership interest, for the purpose of facilitating the domestic or foreign business operations of the association, except that if the ownership interest by an eligible cooperative association, or associations, is less than 50 percent, the financing shall be limited to the percentage held in the party by the association or associations.

(4) a percentage of the voting control of the association not less than 80 per centum (60 per centum (A) in the case of rural electric, telephone, public utility, and service cooperatives; (B) in the case of local farm supply cooperatives that have historically served needs of the community that would not adequately be served by other suppliers and have experienced a reduction in the percentage of farmer membership due to changed circumstances beyond their control such as, but not limited to, urbanization of the community; and (C) in the case of local farm supply cooperatives that provide or will provide needed services to a community and that are or will be in competition with a cooperative specified in paragraph (B)) or, with respect to any type of association or cooperative, such higher percentage as established by the bank board, is held by farmers, producers or harvesters of aquatic products, or eligible cooperative associations as defined herein;

(C) Any cooperative or other entity described in subsection (b) or (f) of section 2128 of this title.
(D) Any creditworthy private entity that satisfies the requirements for a service cooperative under paragraphs (1), (2), and (4), or under the last sentence, of subsection (a) of this section and subsidiaries of the entity, if the entity is organized to benefit agriculture in furtherance of the welfare of its farmer-members and is operated on a not-for-profit basis.

§2130. Ownership of stock by borrowers
(a) Each borrower entitled to hold voting stock shall, at the time a loan is made by a bank for cooperatives, own at least one share of voting stock and shall be required by the bank to invest in additional voting stock or nonvoting investment stock at that time, or from time to time, as the lending bank may determine, but the requirement for investment in stock at the time the loan is closed shall not exceed an amount equal to 10 per centum of the face amount of the loan. Such additional ownership requirements may be based on the face amount of the loan, the outstanding loan balance or on a percentage of the interest payable by the borrower during any year or during any quarter thereof, or upon such other basis as the bank determines will provide adequate capital for the operation of the bank and equitable ownership thereof among borrowers. In the case of a direct loan by the Central Bank, the borrower shall be required to own or invest in the necessary stock in a district bank or banks and such district bank shall be required to own a corresponding amount of stock in the Central Bank, but voting stock shall be in the one district bank, designated by the Farm Credit Administration.

(d) Cancellation; application on indebtedness
In any case where the debt of a borrower is in default, or in any case of liquidation or dissolution of a present or former borrower from a bank for cooperatives, the bank may, but shall not be required to, retire and cancel all or a part of the stock, allocated surplus or contingency reserves, or any other equity in the bank owned by or allocated to such borrower, at the fair market value thereof not exceeding par, and, to the extent required in such cases, corresponding shares and allocations and other equity interests held by a district bank in another district bank on account of such indebtedness, shall be retired or equitably adjusted. In no event shall the bank's equities be retired or canceled if the retirement or cancellation would adversely affect the bank's capital structure, as determined by the Farm Credit Administration.

(a) Application of savings
At the end of each fiscal year, the net savings shall, under regulations prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration, continue to be applied on a cooperative basis with provision for sound, adequate capitalization to meet the changing financing needs of eligible cooperative borrowers and prudent corporate fiscal management, to the end that current year's patrons carry their fair share of the capitalization, ultimate expenses, and reserves related to the year's operations and the remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. Such regulations may provide for application of net savings to the restoration or maintenance of an allocated surplus account, reasonable additions to unallocated surplus, or to unallocated reserves after payment of operating expenses, and provide for allocations to patrons not qualified under title 26, or payment of such per centum of patronage refunds in cash, as the board may determine.

(b) Patronage refunds
The net savings of each district bank for cooperatives, after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be paid in stock, participation certificates, or cash, or in any of them, as determined by its board, as patronage refunds to borrowers to whom such refunds are payable who are borrowers of the fiscal year for which such patronage refunds are distributed. Except as provided in subsection (c) below, all patronage refunds shall be paid in proportion that the amount of interest and service fees on the loans to each borrower during the year bears to the interest and service fees on the loans of all borrowers during the year or on such other proportionate patronage basis as may be approved by the board of directors.

(c) Savings of Central Bank for Cooperatives
The net savings of the Central Bank for Cooperatives after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be paid in stock or cash, or both, as determined by the board, as patronage refunds to the district banks on the basis of interests held by the Central Bank in loans made by the district banks and upon any direct loans made by the Central Bank to cooperative associations, or on such other proportionate patronage basis as may be approved by the board of directors. In cases of direct loans, such refund shall be paid to the district bank or banks which issued their stock to the borrower incident to such loans, and the district bank or banks shall issue a like amount of patronage refunds to the borrower.

(d) Loss carryover
In the event of a net loss in any fiscal year after providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any applicable reserves), such loss may be carried forward or carried back, if appropriate, or otherwise shall be absorbed by charges to unallocated reserve or surplus accounts established after December 10, 1971; charges to allocated contingency reserve account; charges to allocated surplus accounts; charges to other contingency reserve and surplus accounts; the impairment of voting stock; or the impairment of all other stock.

(e) Charge of unrecognized costs or expenses to reserve, surplus, or patronage allocations
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section any costs or expenses attributable to a prior year or years but not recognized in determining the net savings for such year or years may be charged to reserves or surplus of the bank or to patronage allocations for such years, as may be determined by the board of directors.

(f) Payment of patronage refunds in cash
A bank for cooperatives may pay in cash such portion of its patronage refunds as will permit its taxable income to be determined without taking into account savings applied as allocated surplus, allocated contingency reserves, and patronage refunds under subsection (a) of this section.

§2133. Distribution of assets on liquidation or dissolution
In the case of liquidation or dissolution of any bank for cooperatives, after payment or retirement, first, of all liabilities; second, of all capital stock issued before January 1, 1956, at par, and all nonvoting stock at par; and third, all voting stock at par; any surplus and reserves existing on January 1, 1956, shall be paid to the holders of stock issued before that date, and voting stock pro rata; and any remaining allocated surplus and reserves shall be distributed to those entities to which they are allocated on the books of the bank, and any other remaining surplus shall be paid to the holders of outstanding voting stock. If it should become necessary to use any surplus or reserves to pay any liabilities or to retire any capital stock, unallocated reserves or surplus, allocated reserves and surplus shall be exhausted in accordance with rules prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration.

§2134. Taxation
Each bank for cooperatives and its obligations are instrumentalities of the United States and as such any and all notes, debentures, and other obligations issued by such bank shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any State, territorial, or local taxing authority, except that interest on such obligations shall be subject to Federal income taxation in the hands of the holder.

§2154. Capital adequacy of banks and institutions

(a) Minimum levels of capital
The Farm Credit Administration shall cause System institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such System institutions and by using such other methods as the Farm Credit Administration deems appropriate.

(b) Failure to maintain minimum levels; directives; plans for achieving minimum levels; proposals affecting compliance
(1) Failure of a System institution to maintain capital at or above its minimum level as established under subsection (a) of this section may be deemed by the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice within the meaning of this chapter.
(2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (1), the Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive to a System institution that fails to maintain capital at or above its required level as established under subsection (a) of this section. Such directive may require the System institution to submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit Administration describing the means and timing by which the System institution shall achieve its required capital level, but may not require merger or consolidation without a majority vote of the voting stockholders or the contributors to the guaranty fund of the institution.
(3) The Farm Credit Administration may consider such System institution's progress in adhering to any plan required under paragraph (2) whenever such System institution, or an affiliate thereof, seeks the requisite approval of the Farm Credit Administration for any proposal that would divert earnings, diminish capital, or otherwise impede such System institution's progress in achieving its minimum capital level. The Farm Credit Administration may deny such approval where it determines that such proposal would adversely affect the ability of the System institution to comply with such plan.

(c) Enhancement of capital adequacy of banks
Each bank shall have on hand at the time of issuance of any note, bond, debenture, or other similar obligation and at all times thereafter maintain, free from any lien or other pledge, notes and other obligations representing loans made under this chapter or real or personal property acquired in connection with loans made under this chapter, obligations of the United States or any agency thereof direct or fully guaranteed, other bank assets (including marketable securities) approved by the Farm Credit Administration, or cash, in an aggregate value equal to the total amount of notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations outstanding for which the bank is primarily liable.

Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease and desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Farm Credit Administration may issue and serve upon the institution or the director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice.

In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such crime is entered against such director, officer, or other person, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Farm Credit Administration may, if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or may threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System, issue and serve upon such director, officer, or other person an order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such director, officer, or other person from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution except with the consent of the Farm Credit Administration. A copy of such order shall also be served upon such institution, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such institution. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Farm Credit Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to remove such director, officer, or other person from office or to prohibit further participation in Farm Credit System affairs under section 2264 of this title. Any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under this paragraph shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any hearing or appeal authorized under subsection (b) of this section unless terminated by the Farm Credit Administration.
(b) Within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under subsection (a) of this section, the director, officer, or other person concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Farm Credit Administration to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution by such individual does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interest of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System. Upon receipt of any such request, the Farm Credit Administration shall fix a time (not more than thirty days after receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of the concerned director, officer, or other person) and place at which the director, officer, or other person may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration or designated employees of the Farm Credit Administration to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Farm Credit Administration, oral testimony) and oral argument. Within sixty days of such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall notify the director, officer, or other person whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such individual from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Farm Credit Administration's decision, if adverse to the director, officer, or other person. The Farm Credit Administration may prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.

(i) upward or downward adjustment, as appropriate, by the Financial Assistance Corporation during each of the last 5 years prior to the date the Financial Assistance Corporation is obligated to make the repayment, in order to ensure that the Financial Assistance Corporation will have the amount of funds needed to make the repayment on the due date; and

Any bank terminating System status pursuant to section 2279d of this title shall be required, under regulations of the Farm Credit Administration, to pay to the Financial Assistance Corporation the estimated present value of all future such assessments against the bank had the bank remained in the System.

(D) Funds for payments
Payments under subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be made by each such institution from the funds of the institution or from funds raised by the institution through the issuance of debt obligations, which may be issued without a collateral requirement and without any guarantee by the Secretary of the Treasury.

(ii) Availability of evaluation
A copy of the evaluation required under clause (i) shall be furnished to the Secretary of the Treasury and the appropriate committees of Congress.

(iii) Redemption by institution; purchase by Secretary of the Treasury
If the Farm Credit Administration determines, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, on the basis of the evaluation required under clause (i), that the redemption of such stock at par value would impair the other stock or equities of such institution or render such institution incapable of meeting its capital adequacy standards, the institution shall be prohibited from redeeming the preferred stock it issued under section 2278b–7 of this title with respect to the maturing obligation. If the Farm Credit Administration determines, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, on the basis of the evaluation required under clause (i), that such institution will be able to redeem, in a timely manner and at par value, the preferred stock it issued under section 2278b–7 of this title with respect to the maturing obligation, and remain a viable and competitive institution, such institution shall have the option of redeeming or not redeeming such stock. If such institution is prohibited from redeeming or elects not to redeem such stock, the Financial Assistance Corporation shall withdraw funds from the Trust Fund in an amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock issued by such institution under section 2278b–7 of this title so as to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the principal of the maturing obligation. Simultaneously with such withdrawal of funds from the Trust Fund, the Financial Assistance Corporation shall transfer to the Insurance Fund an equal amount, at par value, of preferred stock of such institution. To the extent that the Trust Fund is insufficient to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the full principal of the maturing obligation, the Insurance Fund shall be used by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation to purchase, at par value, the preferred stock issued by such institution under section 2278b–7(a) of this title to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the principal of the maturing obligation. To the extent that the Insurance Fund is insufficient to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the full principal of the maturing obligation, the Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase, at par value, the remaining quantity of the preferred stock issued by such institution to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to make such full payment. For that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include such purchases of stock. Any preferred stock transferred to, or purchased by, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation under this clause shall be retired by the issuing institution at such times and under such terms and conditions as are agreed to between the Insurance Corporation and such institution.

A defaulting bank shall be liable to the remaining System banks for any amounts paid by the remaining banks under this paragraph.

If the Secretary has not recovered the full amount due from the defaulting bank by the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of payment by the Secretary, the uncollected amount shall be paid to the Secretary from the Insurance Fund established under section 2277a–9 of this title.

(ii) Principal of bonds issued to fund purchase of preferred stock
In each instance in which the Secretary of the Treasury is required under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) to purchase preferred stock issued by a System institution under section 2278b–7(a) of this title, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall use funds deposited in the Insurance Fund to repurchase, at par value, from the Secretary of the Treasury such stock required to be purchased under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) as funds become available for such repurchase.

(iii) Priority
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter except for section 2277a–9(c)(2)(B) of this title, during any year in which payments are due to the Secretary of the Treasury from the Insurance Fund under clause (i), or preferred stock held by the Secretary is due to be repurchased by the Insurance Fund under clause (ii), the funds in such Fund, and all funds deposited in such Fund during such year, shall be used first for the purposes specified in clauses (i) and (ii).

(b) Borrowers rights
At the time of application for a loan (as defined in section 2202a(a)(5) of this title), originators that are Farm Credit System institutions shall give written notice to each applicant of the terms and conditions of the loan, setting forth separately terms and conditions for pooled loans and loans that are not pooled.

Not sooner than the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on February 10, 1996, the Director of the Office of Secondary Market Oversight shall, by regulation, establish a risk-based capital test under this section for the Corporation. When applied to the Corporation, the risk-based capital test shall determine the amount of regulatory capital for the Corporation that is sufficient for the Corporation to maintain positive capital during a 10-year period in which both of the following circumstances occur:

(1) Credit risk

(A) In general
With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, a pool of qualified loans owned or guaranteed by the Corporation and other obligations of the Corporation, losses on the underlying qualified loans occur throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity (based on any measurements of default reasonably related to prevailing industry practice in determining capital adequacy) reasonably related to the rate and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United States containing an aggregate of not less than 5 percent of the total population of the United States that, for a period of not less than 2 years (as established by the Director), experienced the highest rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses, in comparison with such rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses in other such areas for any period of such duration, as determined by the Director.

(B) Rural utility loans
With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligation backed by, a pool of qualified loans described in section 2279aa(9)(C) of this title owned or guaranteed by the Corporation, losses occur at a rate of default and severity reasonably related to risks in electric and telephone facility loans (as applicable), as determined by the Director.

(2) Interest rate risk
Interest rates on Treasury obligations of varying terms increase or decrease over the first 12 months of such 10-year period by not more than the lesser of (A) 50 percent (with respect to the average interest rates on such obligations during the 12-month period preceding the 10-year period), or (B) 600 basis points, and remain at such level for the remainder of the period. This paragraph may not be construed to require the Director to determine interest rate risk under this paragraph based on the interest rates for various long-term and short-term obligations all increasing or all decreasing concurrently.

(b) Considerations

(1) Establishment of test
In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) of this section—
(A) the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions based on various types of agricultural mortgage products, varying terms of Treasury obligations, and any other factors the Director considers appropriate;
(B) the Director shall conform loan data used in determining credit risk to the minimum geographic and commodity diversification standards applicable to pools of qualified loans eligible for guarantee;
(C) the Director may take into account retained subordinated participating interests under section 2279aa–6(b)(2) of this title (as in effect before February 10, 1996);

To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of regulatory capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) of this section to the Corporation.
