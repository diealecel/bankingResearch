§6001. Establishment of program

(a) In general
The Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may, in accordance with section 6002 of this title, make grants to States, political subdivisions of States, and nonprofit organizations for programs that require or encourage individuals under the age of 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets. In making those grants, the Administrator shall allow grantees to use wide discretion in designing programs that effectively promote increased bicycle helmet use.

(b) Federal share
The amount provided by a grant under this section shall not exceed 80 percent of the cost of the program for which the grant is made. In crediting the recipient State, political subdivision, or nonprofit organization for the non-Federal share of the cost of such a program (other than planning and administration), the aggregate of all expenditures made by such State, political subdivision, or nonprofit organization (exclusive of Federal funds) for the purposes described in section 6002 of this title (other than expenditures for planning and administration) shall be available for such crediting, without regard to whether such expenditures were actually made in connection with such program.

§6002. Purposes for grants
A grant made under section 6001 of this title may be used by a grantee to—
(1) enforce a law that requires individuals under the age of 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets on their heads while riding on bicycles;
(2) provide assistance, to individuals under the age of 16 who may not be able to afford approved bicycle helmets, to enable such individuals to acquire such helmets;
(3) develop and administer a program to educate individuals under the age of 16 and their families on the importance of wearing such helmets in order to improve bicycle safety; or
(4) carry out any combination of the activities described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
The Administrator shall review grant applications for compliance with this section prior to awarding grants.

§6003. Report to Congress
Not later than May 1, 1997, the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shall report to Congress on the effectiveness of the grant program established by section 6001 of this title. The report shall include a list of grant recipients, a summary of the types of programs implemented by the grantees, and any recommendation by the Administrator regarding how the program should be changed in the future.
