§4801. Findings and purpose

(a) Findings
The Congress finds that—

(i) reveal sectoral strengths and weaknesses;
(ii) identify potential new markets and future technological and economic trends; and
(iii) provide necessary information regarding the competitive strategies of foreign competitors;
(B) the lack of a coherent and consistent government competitiveness policy, including policies with respect to—
(i) international trade, finance, and investment,
(ii) research, science, and technology,
(iii) education, labor retraining, and adjustment,

(v) antitrust and regulation, and
(vi) government procurement;
(2) the United States economy benefits when business, labor, government, academia, and public interest groups work together cooperatively;
