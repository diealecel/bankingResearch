Nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed to exclude the Federal Government from enforcing the provision of this chapter within any State, whether or not such State has enacted legislation on the same subject, it being the intent of the Congress to establish concurrent jurisdiction with the States over such subject matter. In no case shall any such State take any action pursuant to this section involving a violation of any such law of that State which would preclude the United States from enforcing the provisions of this chapter against any person.

§1830. Report to the Congress
On or before the expiration of thirty calendar months following December 9, 1970, and every twelve calendar months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report upon the matters covered by this chapter, including enforcement and other actions taken thereunder, together with such recommendations for legislative and other action as he deems appropriate.
