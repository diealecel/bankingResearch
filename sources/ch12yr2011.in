<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">All savings accounts and demand accounts shall have the same priority upon liquidation. Holders of accounts and obligors of a Federal savings association shall, to such extent as may be provided by its charter or by regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, be members of the savings association, and shall have such voting rights and such other rights as are thereby provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A Federal savings association may require not less than 14 days notice prior to payment of savings accounts if the charter of the savings association or the regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency so provide.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Federal savings association may not make any loan of funds borrowed under subparagraph (A) at an interest rate which exceeds by more than 1¾ percent per annum the interest rate paid to the State mortgage finance agency on the obligations issued to obtain the funds so borrowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Mutual capital certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations issued by the Comptroller of the Currency, mutual capital certificates may be issued and sold directly to subscribers or through underwriters. Such certificates may be included in calculating capital for the purpose of subsection (t) of this section to the extent permitted by the Comptroller of the Currency. The issuance of cer<!-- PDFPage:346 -->tificates under this paragraph does not constitute a change of control or ownership under this chapter or any other law unless there is in fact a change in control or reorganization.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company conducts activities other than financial activities, the Board may require such company to establish and conduct all or a portion of such financial activities in or through an intermediate holding company, which shall be a savings and loan holding company, established pursuant to regulations of the Board, not later than 90 days (or such longer period as the Board may deem appropriate) after the transfer date.<sup><a href="#1467b_1_target" name="1467b_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board shall require a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company to establish an intermediate holding company if the Board makes a determination that the establishment of such intermediate holding company is necessary—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to appropriately supervise activities that are determined to be financial activities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to ensure that supervision by the Board does not extend to the activities of such company that are not financial activities.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Grandfathered activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company may continue to engage in an internal financial activity, subject to review by the Board to determine whether engaging in such activity presents undue risk to the grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company or to the financial stability of the United States, if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, may from time to time, examine and require reports under oath from a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that controls an intermediate holding company, and from the appropriate officers or directors of such company, solely for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section, including assessing the ability of the company to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company as required under paragraph (3) and enforcing compliance with such requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limited parent company enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to any other authority of the Board, the Board may enforce compliance with the provisions of this subsection that are applicable to any company described in paragraph (1)(A) that controls an intermediate holding company under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode edition="2011" section="1818" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1818</uscode>], and a company described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be subject to such section (solely for purposes of this subparagraph) in the same manner and to the same extent as if the company described in paragraph (1)(A) were a savings and loan holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of other Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any violation of this subsection by a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that controls an intermediate holding company may also be treated as a violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode edition="2011" section="1811" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.</uscode>] for purposes of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No effect on other authority</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall promulgate regulations to establish the criteria for determining whether to re<!-- PDFPage:402 -->quire a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company to establish an intermediate holding company under subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may promulgate regulations to establish any restrictions or limitations on transactions between an intermediate holding company or a parent of such company and its affiliates, as necessary to prevent unsafe and unsound practices in connection with transactions between the intermediate holding company, or any subsidiary thereof, and its parent company or affiliates that are not subsidiaries of the intermediate holding company, except that such regulations shall not restrict or limit any transaction in connection with the bona fide acquisition or lease by an unaffiliated person of assets, goods, or services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules of construction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company to conform its activities to permissible activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permissible corporate reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The formation of an intermediate holding company as required in subsection (b) shall be presumed to be a permissible corporate reorganization as described in <uscode detail="(c)(9)(D)" edition="2011" section="1467a" title="12">section 1467a(c)(9)(D) of this title</uscode>.</p>
