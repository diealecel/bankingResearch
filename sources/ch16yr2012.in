<!-- PDFPage:950 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of denial of application for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board of Directors votes to deny any application for insurance by any depository institution, the Board of Directors shall promptly notify the appropriate Federal banking agency and, in the case of any State depository institution, the appropriate State banking supervisor of the denial of such application, giving specific reasons in writing for the Board of Directors’ determination with reference to the factors described in <uscode edition="2012" section="1816" title="12">section 1816 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nondelegation requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of the Board of Directors to make any determination to deny any application under this subsection may not be delegated by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreign branch nonmember banks; matters considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this chapter and to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may impose, any branch of a foreign bank, upon application by the bank to the Corporation, and examination by the Corporation of the branch, and approval by the Board of Directors, may become an insured branch. Before approving any such application, the Board of Directors shall give consideration to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial history and condition of the bank,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the adequacy of its capital structure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) its future earnings prospects,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the general character and fitness of its management, including but not limited to the management of the branch proposed to be insured,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the risk presented to the Deposit Insurance Fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the convenience and needs of the community to be served by the branch,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether or not its corporate powers, insofar as they will be exercised through the proposed insured branch, are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the probable adequacy and reliability of information supplied and to be supplied by the bank to the Corporation to enable it to carry out its functions under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection to Deposit Insurance Fund; surety bond, pledge of assets, etc.; injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall deliver to the Corporation or as the Corporation may direct a surety bond, a pledge of assets, or both, in such amounts and of such types as the Corporation may require or approve, for the purpose set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall maintain on deposit with the Corporation, or as the Corporation may direct, surety bonds or assets or both, in such amounts and of such types as shall be determined from time to time in accordance with such regulations as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Such regulations may impose differing requirements on the basis of any factors which in the judgment of the Board of Directors are reasonably related to the purpose set forth in paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Corporation may require of any given bank larger deposits of bonds and assets than required under paragraph (2) of this subsection if, in the judgment of the Corporation, the situation of that bank or any branch thereof is or becomes such that the deposits of bonds and assets otherwise required under this section would not adequately fulfill the purpose set forth in paragraph (4). The imposition of any such additional requirements may be without notice or opportunity for hearing, but the Corporation shall afford an opportunity to any such bank to apply for a reduction or removal of any such additional requirements so imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The purpose of the surety bonds and pledges of assets required under this subsection is to provide protection to the Deposit Insurance Fund against the risks entailed in insuring the domestic deposits of a foreign bank whose activities, assets, and personnel are in large part outside the jurisdiction of the United States. In the implementation of its authority under this subsection, however, the Corporation shall endeavor to avoid imposing requirements on such banks which would unnecessarily place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestically incorporated banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any failure or threatened failure of a foreign bank to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection (c), the Corporation, in addition to all other administrative and judicial remedies, may apply to any United States district court, or United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which any branch of the bank is located, for an injunction to compel such bank and any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or any other person having custody or control of any of its assets, to deliver to the Corporation such assets as may be necessary to meet such requirement, and to take any other action necessary to vest the Corporation with control of assets so delivered. If the court shall determine that there has been any such failure or threatened failure to comply with any such requirement, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction. The propriety of the requirement may be litigated only as provided in <uscode chapter="7" edition="2012" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>, and may not be made an issue in an action for an injunction under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any institution that becomes insured by the Corporation, and any noninsured branch that becomes insured by the Corporation, shall pay the Corporation any fee which the Corporation may by regulation prescribe, after giving due consideration to the need to establish and maintain the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of condition; access to reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each insured State nonmember bank and each foreign bank having an insured branch which is not a Federal branch shall make to the Corporation reports of condition which shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board of Directors may require. Such reports shall be made to the Corporation on the dates selected as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and the deposit liabilities shall be reported therein in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. The Board of Directors may call for additional reports of condition on dates to be fixed by it and may call for such other reports as the Board may from time to time require. Any such bank which (A) maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or (B) inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Such bank shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any such bank which fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any such bank knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Corporation may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such bank, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Corporation in the manner provided in subparagraphs (E), (F), (G), and (I) of <uscode detail="(i)(2)" edition="2012" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(i)(2) of this title</uscode> (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any such bank against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such bank submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. <uscode detail="(h)" edition="2012" section="1818" title="12">Section 1818(h) of this title</uscode> shall apply to any proceeding under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Corporation and, with respect to any State depository institution, any appropriate State bank supervisor for such institution, shall have access to reports of examination made by, and reports of condition made to, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, any Federal home loan bank, or any Federal Reserve bank and to all revisions of reports of condition made to any of them, and they shall promptly advise the Corporation of any revisions or changes in respect to deposit liabilities made or required to be made in any report of condition. The Corporation may accept any report made by or to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a depository institution, and may furnish to the Comptroller of the Currency, to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to any Federal home loan bank, to any Federal Reserve <!-- PDFPage:957 -->bank, and to any such commission, board, or authority, reports of examinations made on behalf of, and reports of condition made to, the Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Additional reports</cap-smallcap>.—The Board of Directors may from time to time require any insured depository institution to file such additional reports as the Corporation, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as appropriate, may deem advisable for insurance purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) <cap-smallcap>Data sharing with other agencies and persons</cap-smallcap>.—In addition to reports of examination, reports of condition, and other reports required to be regularly provided to the Corporation (with respect to all insured depository institutions, including a depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed conservator or receiver) or an appropriate State bank supervisor (with respect to a State depository institution) under subparagraph (A) or (B), a Federal banking agency may, in the discretion of the agency, furnish any report of examination or other confidential supervisory information concerning any depository institution or other entity examined by such agency under authority of any Federal law, to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any other Federal or State agency or authority with supervisory or regulatory authority over the depository institution or other entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any officer, director, or receiver of such depository institution or entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any other person that the Federal banking agency determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each insured depository institution shall make to the appropriate Federal banking agency 4 reports of condition annually upon dates which shall be selected by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The dates selected shall be the same for all insured depository institutions, except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any depository institution, the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. Such reports of condition shall be the basis for the certified statements to be filed pursuant to subsection (c). The deposit liabilities shall be reported in said reports of conditions in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection, and such other information shall be reported therein as may be required by the respective agencies. Each said report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, a vice president, the cashier or the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. The correctness of said report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of at least two directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution other than the officer making such declaration, with a declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct. At the time of making said reports of condition each insured depository institution shall furnish to the Corporation a copy thereof containing such signed declaration and attestations. Nothing herein shall preclude any of the foregoing agencies from requiring the banks or savings associations under its jurisdiction to make additional reports of condition at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the reports of condition required to be made by paragraph (3) of this subsection, each insured depository institution shall report the total amount of the liability of the depository institution for deposits in the main office and in any branch located in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any Territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, according to the definition of the term “deposit” in and pursuant to subsection (l) of <uscode edition="2012" section="1813" title="12">section 1813 of this title</uscode> without any deduction for indebtedness of depositors or creditors or any deduction for cash items in the process of collection drawn on others than the reporting depository institution: <em>Provided</em>, That the depository institution in reporting such deposits may (i) subtract from the deposit balance due to any depository institution the deposit balance due from the same depository institution (other than trust funds deposited by either depository institution) and any cash items in the process of collection due from or due to such depository institutions shall be included in determining such net balance, except that balances of time deposits of any depository institution and any balances standing to the credit of private depository institutions, of depository institutions in foreign countries, of foreign branches of other American depository institutions, and of American branches of foreign banks shall be reported gross without any such subtraction, and (ii) exclude any deposits received in any office of the depository institution for deposit in any other office of the depository institution: <em>And provided further</em>, That outstanding drafts (including advices and authorizations to charge depository institution's balance in another depository institution) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting depository institution on depository institutions need not be reported as deposit liabilities. The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution's own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The deposits to be reported on such reports of condition shall be segregated between (i) time and savings deposits and (ii) demand deposits. For this purpose, the time and savings deposits shall consist of time certificates of deposit, time deposits-open account, and savings deposits; and demand deposits shall consist of all deposits other than time and savings deposits.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:958 --><p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Lifeline account deposits</cap-smallcap>.—In the reports of condition required to be reported under this subsection, the deposits in lifeline accounts (as defined in <uscode detail="(a)(3)(D)" edition="2012" section="1834" title="12">section 1834(a)(3)(D) of this title</uscode>) shall be reported separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Board of Directors, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may by regulation define the terms “cash items” and “process of collection”, and shall classify deposits as “time”, “savings”, and “demand” deposits, for the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In respect of any report required or authorized to be supplied or published pursuant to this subsection or any other provision of law, the Board of Directors or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may differentiate between domestic banks and foreign banks to such extent as, in their judgment, may be reasonably required to avoid hardship and can be done without substantial compromise of insurance risk or supervisory and regulatory effectiveness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>Data collections</cap-smallcap>.—In addition to or in connection with any other report required under this subsection, the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each insured depository institution maintains; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Corporation receives on a regular basis from such institution,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">information on the total amount of all insured deposits, preferred deposits, and uninsured deposits at the institution. In prescribing reporting and other requirements for the collection of actual and accurate information pursuant to this paragraph, the Corporation shall minimize the regulatory burden imposed upon insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in <uscode edition="2012" section="1831o" title="12">section 1831o of this title</uscode>) while taking into account the benefit of the information to the Corporation, including the use of the information to enable the Corporation to more accurately determine the total amount of insured deposits in each insured depository institution for purposes of compliance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) A Federal banking agency may not, by regulation or otherwise, designate, or require an insured institution or an affiliate to designate, a corporation as highly leveraged or a transaction with a corporation as a highly leveraged transaction solely because such corporation is or has been a debtor or bankrupt under title 11, if, after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, such corporation would not otherwise be highly leveraged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) <cap-smallcap>Streamlining reports of condition.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Review of information and schedules</cap-smallcap>.—Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on October 13, 2006, and before the end of each 5-year period thereafter, each Federal banking agency shall, in conjunction with the other relevant Federal banking agencies, review the information and schedules that are required to be filed by an insured depository institution in a report of condition required under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Reduction or elimination of information found to be unnecessary</cap-smallcap>.—After completing the review required by subparagraph (A), a Federal banking agency, in conjunction with the other relevant Federal banking agencies, shall reduce or eliminate any requirement to file information or schedules under paragraph (3) (other than information or schedules that are otherwise required by law) if the agency determines that the continued collection of such information or schedules is no longer necessary or appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Termination of insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any insured depository institution which is not—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a national member bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a State member bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a Federal branch;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a Federal savings association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an insured branch which is required to be insured under subsection (a) or (b) <sup><a href="#1818_1_target" name="1818_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="2012" section="3104" title="12">section 3104 of this title</uscode>,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">may terminate such depository institution's status as an insured depository institution if such insured institution provides written notice to the Corporation of the institution's intent to terminate such status not less than 90 days before the effective date of such termination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Involuntary termination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice to primary regulator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board of Directors determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an insured depository institution or the directors or trustees of an insured depository institution have engaged or are engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of the depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an insured depository institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an insured depository institution or the directors or trustees of the insured institution have violated any applicable law, regulation, order, condition imposed in writing by the Corporation in connection with the approval of any application or other request by the insured depository institution, or written agreement entered into between the insured depository institution and the Corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Board of Directors shall notify the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to such institution (if other than the Corporation) or the State banking supervisor of such institution (if the Corporation is the appropriate Federal banking agency) of the Board's determination and the facts and circumstances on which such determination is based for the purpose of securing the correction of such practice, condition, or violation. Such notice shall be given to the appropriate Federal banking agency not less than 30 days before the notice required by subparagraph (B), except that this period for notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency may be reduced or eliminated with the agreement of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of intention to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after giving the notice required under subparagraph (A) with respect to an insured depository institution, the Board of Directors determines that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in such notice requires the termination of the insured status of the insured depository institution, the Board shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serve written notice to the insured depository institution of the Board's intention to terminate the insured status of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide the insured depository institution with a statement of the charges on the basis of which the determination to terminate such institution's insured status was made (or a copy of the notice under subparagraph (A)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) notify the insured depository institution of the date (not less than 30 days after notice under this subparagraph) and place for a hearing before the Board of Directors (or any person designated by the Board) with respect to the termination of the institution's insured status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hearing; termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of the evidence presented at a hearing before the Board of Directors (or any person designated by the Board for such purpose), in which all issues shall be determined on the record pursuant to <uscode edition="2012" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode> and the written findings of the Board of Directors (or such person) with respect to such evi<!-- PDFPage:981 -->dence (which shall be conclusive), the Board of Directors finds that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in the notice to an insured depository institution under paragraph (2)(B) or subsection (w) of this section has been established, the Board of Directors may issue an order terminating the insured status of such depository institution effective as of a date subsequent to such finding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appearance; consent to termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the depository institution shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured depository institution and termination of such status thereupon may be ordered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any insured depository institution whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board of Directors under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Publication of notice of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may publish notice of such termination and the depository institution shall give notice of such termination to each of its depositors at his last address of record on the books of the depository institution, in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Temporary insurance of deposits insured as of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the termination of the insured status of any depository institution under the provisions of this subsection, the insured deposits of each depositor in the depository institution on the date of such termination, less all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue for a period of at least 6 months or up to 2 years, within the discretion of the Board of Directors, to be insured, and the depository institution shall continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an insured depository institution during such period. No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such depository institution made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the depository institution shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not so insured. Such depository institution shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured depository institution for the period referred to in the 1st sentence from the date of such termination, and in the event that such depository institution shall be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors within such period, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such depository institution as in case of an insured depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Temporary suspension of insurance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board of Directors initiates a termination proceeding under paragraph (2), and the Board of Directors, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency, finds that an insured depository institution (other than a savings association to which subparagraph (B) applies) has no tangible capital under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain savings institutions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Certain goodwill included in tangible capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the tangible capital of a savings association for purposes of this paragraph, the Board of Directors shall include goodwill to the extent it is considered a component of capital under <uscode detail="(t)" edition="2012" section="1464" title="12">section 1464(t) of this title</uscode>. Any savings association which would be subject to a suspension order under subparagraph (A) but for the operation of this subparagraph, shall be considered by the Corporation to be a “special supervisory association”.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Suspension order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by a special supervisory association whenever the Board of Directors determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the capital of such association, as computed utilizing applicable accounting standards, has suffered a material decline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that such association (or its directors or officers) is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the association;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) that such association is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operating as an insured association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) that such association (or its directors or officers) has violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency, or any written agreement including a capital improvement plan entered into with any Federal banking agency, or that the association has failed to enter into a capital improvement plan which is acceptable to the Corporation within the time period set forth in <uscode detail="(t)" edition="2012" section="1464" title="12">section 1464(t) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3"> Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency to enforce a contractual provision which authorizes the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as a successor to the Federal Savings and Loan In<!-- PDFPage:982 -->surance Corporation or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to require a savings association to write down or amortize goodwill at a faster rate than otherwise required under this chapter or under applicable accounting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective period of temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any order issued under subparagraph (A) shall become effective not earlier than 10 days from the date of service upon the institution and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized hereunder, such temporary order shall remain effective and enforceable until an order of the Board under paragraph (3) becomes final or until the Corporation dismisses the proceedings under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the close of the 10-day period beginning on the date any temporary order has been served upon an insured depository institution under subparagraph (A), such institution may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the institution is located, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Continuation of insurance for prior deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The insured deposits of each depositor in such depository institution on the effective date of the order issued under this paragraph, minus all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue to be insured, subject to the administrative proceedings as provided in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Publication of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The depository institution shall give notice of such order to each of its depositors in such manner and at such times as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Notice by Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Corporation determines that the depository institution has not substantially complied with the notice to depositors required by the Board of Directors, the Corporation may provide such notice in such manner as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Lack of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any deposit made after the effective date of a suspension order issued under this paragraph shall remain insured to the extent that the depositor establishes that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such deposit consists of additions made by automatic deposit the depositor was unable to prevent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such depositor did not have actual knowledge of the suspension of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Final decisions to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decision by the Board of Directors to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue a temporary order terminating deposit insurance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue a final order terminating deposit insurance (other than under subsection (p) or (q) of this section);</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be made by the Board of Directors and may not be delegated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Low- to moderate-income housing lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any determination regarding the termination of insurance of a solvent savings association, the Corporation may consider the extent of the association's low- to moderate-income housing loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, any insured depository institution, depository institution which has insured deposits, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such depository institution, or is violating or has violated, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the depository institution or institution-affiliated party, or any written agreement entered into with the agency, the appropriate Federal banking agency for the depository institution may issue and serve upon the depository institution or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the agency at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the agency shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the agency may issue and serve upon the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the depository institution or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the <!-- PDFPage:983 -->service of such order upon the depository institution or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the agency or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and <uscode edition="2012" section="1831aa" title="12">section 1831aa of this title</uscode> shall apply to any bank holding company, and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [<uscode edition="2012" section="1841" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.</uscode>], any savings and loan holding company and any subsidiary (other than a depository institution) of a savings and loan holding company (as such terms are defined in <uscode edition="2012" section="1467a" title="12">section 1467a of this title</uscode>)),<sup><a href="#1818_2_target" name="1818_2">2</a></sup> any noninsured State member bank and to any organization organized and operated under section 25(a) <sup><a href="#1818_1_target" name="1818_1">1</a></sup> of the Federal Reserve Act [<uscode edition="2012" section="611" title="12">12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.</uscode>] or operating under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act [<uscode edition="2012" section="601" title="12">12 U.S.C. 601 et seq.</uscode>], in the same manner as they apply to a State member insured bank. Nothing in this subsection or in subsection (c) of this section shall authorize any Federal banking agency, other than the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to issue a notice of charges or cease-and-desist order against a bank holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank or subsidiary of that bank) or against a savings and loan holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a depository institution or a subsidiary of such depository institution).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and <uscode edition="2012" section="1831aa" title="12">section 1831aa of this title</uscode> shall apply to any foreign bank or company to which subsection (a) of <uscode edition="2012" section="3106" title="12">section 3106 of this title</uscode> applies and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of any such foreign bank or company in the same manner as they apply to a bank holding company and any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank) under paragraph (3) of this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “subsidiary” shall have the meaning assigned to it in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [<uscode edition="2012" section="1841" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1841</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) This section shall apply, in the same manner as it applies to any insured depository institution for which the appropriate Federal banking agency is the Comptroller of the Currency, to any national banking association chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency, including an uninsured association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (c) of this section which requires an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such depository institution or such party to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such depository institution or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the appropriate Federal banking agency;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restrict the growth of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) dispose of any loan or asset involved;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) take such other action as the banking agency determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Authority to limit activities</cap-smallcap>.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Unsatisfactory asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity as unsafe or unsound practice</cap-smallcap>.—If an insured depository institution receives, in its most recent report of examination, a less-than-satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity, the appropriate Federal banking agency may (if the deficiency is not corrected) deem the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) [Repealed]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) <cap-smallcap>Standard for certain orders</cap-smallcap>.—No authority under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section to prohibit any institution-affiliated party from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property may be exercised unless the appropriate Federal banking agency meets the standards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, without regard to the requirement of such rule that the applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is irreparable and immediate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary cease-and-desist orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the depository institution, or is likely to weaken the condition of the depository institution or otherwise prejudice the interests of its depositors prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring the depository institution or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice <!-- PDFPage:984 -->pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (b)(6) of this section. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the depository institution or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the agency shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the depository institution or such party, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ten days after the depository institution concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the depository institution or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the depository institution is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Incomplete or inaccurate records.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Temporary order</cap-smallcap>.—If a notice of charges served under subsection (b)(1) of this section specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that an insured depository institution's books and records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the appropriate Federal banking agency is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of that depository institution or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that depository institution, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Effective period</cap-smallcap>.—Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall become effective upon service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (b)(1) of this section in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured depository institution's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the depository institution.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Bond not required; agents; fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation as receiver of an insured depository institution or branch of a foreign bank shall not be required to furnish bond and may appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as such receiver. All fees, compensation, and expenses of liquidation and administration shall be fixed by the Corporation, and may be paid by it out of funds coming into its possession as such receiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of insured deposit as discharge from liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment of an insured deposit to any person by the Corporation shall discharge the Corporation, and payment of a transferred deposit to any person by the new depository institution or by an insured depository institution in which a transferred deposit has been made available shall discharge the Corporation and such new depository institution or other insured depository institution, to the same extent that payment to such person by the depository institution in default would have discharged it from liability for the insured deposit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recognition of claimant not on depository institution records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, neither the Corporation nor such new depository institution or other insured depository institution shall be required to recognize as the owner of any portion of a deposit appearing on the records of the depository institution in default under a name other than that of the claimant, any person whose name or interest as such owner is not disclosed on the records of such depository institution in default as part owner of said deposit, if such recognition would increase the aggregate amount of the insured deposits in such depository institution in default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding payments to meet liability to depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor in a depository institution in default as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor to the depository institution in default or its receiver, which is not offset against a claim due from such depository institution, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disposition of unclaimed deposits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notices</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) First notice</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Second notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A second notice containing this information shall be mailed by the Corporation to all insured depositors who have not responded to the first notice, 15 months after the Corporation initiates such payment of insured depositors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any transferee institution shall refund the deposit to the Corporation, and all rights of the depositor against the transferee institution shall be barred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with the exception of United States deposits, the Corporation shall deliver the deposit to the custody of the appropriate State as unclaimed property, unless the appropriate State declines to accept custody. Upon delivery to the appropriate State, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with respect to the deposit shall be barred and the Corporation shall be deemed to have made payment to the depositor for purposes of <uscode detail="(g)(1)" edition="2012" section="1821" title="12">section 1821(g)(1) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refusal of appropriate State to accept custody</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the appropriate State declines to accept custody of the deposit tendered pursuant to paragraph (2)(B), the deposit shall not be delivered to any State, and the insured depositor shall claim the deposit from the Corporation before the receivership is terminated, or all rights of the depositor with respect to such deposit shall be barred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of United States deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the deposit is a United States deposit it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the <!-- PDFPage:1058 -->Treasury. Upon delivery to the Secretary of the Treasury, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with respect to the deposit shall be barred and the Corporation shall be deemed to have made payment to the depositor for purposes of <uscode detail="(g)(1)" edition="2012" section="1821" title="12">section 1821(g)(1) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a depositor does not claim the deposit delivered to the custody of the appropriate State pursuant to paragraph (2)(B) within 10 years of the date of delivery, the deposit shall be immediately refunded to the Corporation and become its property. All rights of the depositor against the appropriate State with respect to such deposit shall be barred as of the date of the refund to the Corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) The appropriate Federal banking agency has determined that the member's management is competent and has complied with applicable laws, rules, and supervisory directives and orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) The member's management did not engage in insider dealing or speculative practices or other activities that jeopardized the member's safety and soundness or contributed to its impaired capital position.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Corporation consideration of assistance proposal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to the granting of approval of such transaction,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a form approved by the responsible agency,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Reports on competitive factors.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Request for report</cap-smallcap>.—In the interests of uniform standards and subject to subparagraph (B), before acting on any application for approval of a merger transaction, the responsible agency shall—</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.—A responsible agency may not be required to request a report under subparagraph (A) if—</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The responsible agency shall not approve—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any proposed merger transaction which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In every case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The responsible agency shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval by it pursuant to this subsection of a proposed merger transaction. If the agency has found that it must act immediately to prevent the probable failure of one of the insured depository institutions involved, or if the proposed merger transaction is solely between an insured depository institution and 1 or more of its affiliates, and the report on the competitive factors has been dispensed with, the transaction may be consummated immediately upon approval by the agency. If the agency has advised the Attorney General under paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of the existence of an emergency requiring expeditious action and has requested a report on the competitive factors within 10 days, the transaction may not be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency. In all other cases, the transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency or, if the agency has not received any adverse comment from the Attorney General of the United States relating to competitive factors, such shorter period of time as may be prescribed by the agency with the concurrence of the Attorney General, but in no event less than 15 calendar days after the date of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction shall be commenced prior to the earliest time under paragraph (6) at which a merger transaction approved under paragraph (5) might be consummated. The commencement of such an action shall stay the effectiveness of the agency's approval unless the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any such action, the court shall review de novo the issues presented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any judicial proceeding attacking a merger transaction approved under paragraph (5) on the ground that the merger transaction alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="2012" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>, the standards applied by the court shall be identical with those that the banking agencies are directed to apply under paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon the consummation of a merger transaction in compliance with this subsection and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this paragraph, or upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="2012" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>, but nothing in this subsection shall exempt any bank or savings association resulting from a merger transaction from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction approved by a Federal supervisory agency pursuant to this subsection, such agency, and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved, may appear as a part of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) For the purposes of this subsection, the term “antitrust laws” means the Act of July 2, 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act), the Act of October 15, 1914 (the Clayton Act), and any other Acts in pari materia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Each of the responsible agencies shall include in its annual report to the Congress a description of each merger transaction approved by it during the period covered by the report, along with—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the name and total resources of each bank or savings association involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether a report was submitted by the Attorney General under paragraph (4), and, if so, a summary by the Attorney General of the substance of such report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement by the responsible agency of the basis for its approval.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Until June 30, 1976, the responsible agency shall not grant any approval required by law which has the practical effect of permitting a conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organization, including approval of any application pending on the date of enactment of this subsection, except that this sentence shall not <!-- PDFPage:1085 -->be deemed to limit now or hereafter the authority of the responsible agency to grant approvals in cases where the responsible agency finds that it must act in order to maintain the safety, soundness, and stability of an insured depository institution. The responsible agency may by rule, regulation, or otherwise and under such civil penalties (which shall be cumulative to any other remedies) as it may prescribe take whatever action it deems necessary or appropriate to implement or enforce this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) <cap-smallcap>Money laundering</cap-smallcap>.—In every case, the responsible agency, shall take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(13)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the resulting insured depository institution (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the resulting insured depository institution), upon consummation of the transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an interstate merger transaction that involves 1 or more insured depository institutions in default or in danger of default, or with respect to which the Corporation provides assistance under <uscode edition="2012" section="1823" title="12">section 1823 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) adequate records maintained by insured depository institutions have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations or proceedings, and that, given the threat posed to the security of the Nation on and after the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, such records may also have a high degree of usefulness in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against domestic and international terrorism; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) microfilm or other reproductions and other records made by insured depository institutions of checks, as well as records kept by such institutions, of the identity of persons maintaining or authorized to act with respect to accounts therein, have been of particular value in proceedings described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this section to require the maintenance of appropriate types of records by insured depository institutions in the United States where such records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or <!-- PDFPage:1106 -->regulatory investigations or proceedings, recognizing that, given the threat posed to the security of the Nation on and after the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, such records may also have a high degree of usefulness in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recordkeeping regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) determines that the maintenance of appropriate types of records and other evidence by insured depository institutions has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Domestic funds transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Board”) determine that the maintenance of records, by insured depository institutions, of payment orders which direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, the Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section with respect to the maintenance of such records.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) International funds transfers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe, after consultation with State banking supervisors, final regulations requiring that insured depository institutions, businesses that provide check cashing services, money transmitting businesses, and businesses that issue or redeem money orders, travelers’ checks or other similar instruments maintain such records of payment orders which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involve international transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems or on the books of any insured depository institution, or on the books of any business that provides check cashing services, any money transmitting business, and any business that issues or redeems money orders, travelers’ checks or similar instruments,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">that will have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing the regulations required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Board shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings of any record required to be maintained pursuant to the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the effect the recordkeeping required pursuant to such proposed regulations will have on the cost and efficiency of the payment system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Availability of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any records required to be maintained pursuant to the regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) shall be submitted or made available to the Secretary or the Board upon request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Identity of persons having accounts and persons authorized to act with respect to such accounts; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section, each insured depository institution shall maintain such records and other evidence, in such form as the Secretary shall require, of the identity of each person having an account in the United States with the insured depository institution and of each individual authorized to sign checks, make withdrawals, or otherwise act with respect to any such account. The Secretary may make such exemptions from any requirement otherwise imposed under this subsection as are consistent with the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reproduction of checks, drafts, and other instruments; record of transactions; identity of party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insured depository institution shall make, to the extent that the regulations of the Secretary so require—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a microfilm or other reproduction of each check, draft, or similar instrument drawn on it and presented to it for payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a record of each check, draft, or similar instrument received by it for deposit or collection, together with an identification of the party for whose account it is to be deposited or collected, unless the insured depository institution has already made a record of the party's identity pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identity of persons making reportable currency and foreign transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section, whenever any individual engages (whether as principal, agent, or bailee) in any transaction with an insured depository institution which is required to be reported or recorded under subchapter II of <uscode chapter="53" edition="2012" title="31">chapter 53 of title 31</uscode>, the insured depository institution shall require and retain such evidence of the identity of that individual as the Secretary may prescribe as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additions to or substitutes for required records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section and in addition to or in lieu of the records and evidence otherwise referred to in this section, each insured depository institution shall maintain such records and evi<!-- PDFPage:1107 -->dence as the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Retention period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any type of record or evidence required under this section shall be retained for such period as the Secretary may prescribe for the type in question. Any period so prescribed shall not exceed six years unless the Secretary determines, having regard for the purposes of this section, that a longer period is necessary in the case of a particular type of record or evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Report to Congress by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall include in his annual report to the Congress information on his implementation of the authority conferred by this section and any similar authority with respect to recordkeeping or reporting requirements conferred by other provisions of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Application of provisions to foreign banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to any foreign bank except with respect to the transactions and records of any insured branch of such a bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Civil penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Penalty imposed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any insured depository institution and any director, officer, or employee of an insured depository institution who willfully or through gross negligence violates, or any person who willfully causes such a violation, any regulation prescribed under subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of continuing violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A separate violation of any regulation prescribed under subsection (b) of this section occurs for each day the violation continues and at each office, branch, or place of business at which such violation occurs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any penalty imposed under paragraph (1) shall be assessed, mitigated, and collected in the manner provided in subsections (b) and (c) of <uscode edition="2012" section="5321" title="31">section 5321 of title 31</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event that the Board does not conduct examinations required under subsection (b) in the same manner, subject to the same standards, and with the same frequency as would be required if such activities were conducted by the lead insured depository institution subsidiary of the depository institution holding <!-- PDFPage:1113 -->company, the appropriate Federal banking agency for the lead insured depository institution may recommend in writing (which shall include a written explanation of the concerns giving rise to the recommendation) that the Board perform the examination required under subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Examination by an appropriate Federal banking agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board does not, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the Board receives a recommendation under paragraph (1), begin an examination as required under subsection (b) or provide a written explanation or plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency making such recommendation responding to the concerns raised by the appropriate Federal banking agency for the lead insured depository institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency for the lead insured depository institution may, subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, examine the activities that are permissible for a depository institution subsidiary conducted by such nondepository institution subsidiary (other than a functionally regulated subsidiary or a subsidiary of a depository institution) of the depository institution holding company as if the nondepository institution subsidiary were an insured depository institution for which the appropriate Federal banking agency of the lead insured depository institution was the appropriate Federal banking agency, to determine whether the activities—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pose a material threat to the safety and soundness of any insured depository institution subsidiary of the depository institution holding company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are conducted in accordance with applicable Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are subject to appropriate systems for monitoring and controlling the financial, operating, and other material risks of the activities that may pose a material threat to the safety and soundness of the insured depository institution subsidiaries of the holding company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agency coordination with the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An appropriate Federal banking agency that conducts an examination pursuant to paragraph (2) shall coordinate examination of the activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries described in subsection (b) with the Board in a manner that—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shares information relevant to the supervision of the depository institution holding company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) achieves the objectives of subsection (b); and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fee permitted for examination costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An appropriate Federal banking agency that conducts an examination or enforcement action pursuant to this section may collect an assessment, fee, or such other charge from the subsidiary as the appropriate Federal banking agency determines necessary or appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the appropriate Federal banking agency in connection with such examination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Referrals for enforcement by appropriate Federal banking agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recommendation of enforcement action</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Back-up authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the Board receives a recommendation under paragraph (1), the Board does not take enforcement action against the nondepository institution subsidiary or provide a plan for supervisory or enforcement action that is acceptable to the appropriate Federal banking agency that made the recommendation pursuant to paragraph (1), such agency may take the recommended enforcement action against the nondepository institution subsidiary, in the same manner as if the nondepository institution subsidiary were an insured depository institution for which the agency was the appropriate Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coordination among appropriate Federal banking agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal banking agency, prior to or when exercising authority under subsection (d) or (e) shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide reasonable notice to, and consult with, the appropriate Federal banking agency or State bank supervisor (or other State regulatory agency) of the nondepository institution subsidiary of a depository institution holding company that is described in subsection (d) before commencing any examination of the subsidiary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the fullest extent possible—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) rely on the examinations, inspections, and reports of the appropriate Federal banking agency or the State bank supervisor (or other State regulatory agency) of the subsidiary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) avoid duplication of examination activities, reporting requirements, and requests for information; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interest rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered insured depository institutions, including insured savings banks, or insured branches of foreign banks with respect to interest rates, if the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate such State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, such State bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section, take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidence of debt, interest at a rate of not more than 1 per centum in excess of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve bank in the Federal Reserve district where such State bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank is located or at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where the bank is located, whichever may be greater.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the rate prescribed in subsection (a) of this section exceeds the rate such State bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank would be permitted to charge in the absence of this section, and such State fixed rate is thereby preempted by the rate described in subsection (a) of this section, the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a greater rate of interest than is allowed by subsection (a) of this section, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person who paid it may recover in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid from such State bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank taking, receiving, reserving, or charging such interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with Federal banking agencies by insured depository institutions should—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) result in financial statements and reports of condition that accurately reflect the capital of such institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitate effective supervision of the institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) facilitate prompt corrective action to resolve the institutions at the least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Uniform accounting principles consistent with GAAP</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the requirements of this chapter and any other provision of Federal law, the accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with Federal banking agencies by all insured depository institutions shall be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stringency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the appropriate Federal banking agency or the Corporation determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured depository institution is inconsistent with the objectives described in paragraph (1), the agency or the Corporation may, with respect to reports or statements required to be filed with such agency or Corporation, prescribe an accounting principle which is applicable to such institutions which is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review and implementation of accounting principles required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on December 19, 1991, each appropriate Federal banking agency shall take the following actions:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the procedures and format for reports to the agency, including reports of condition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Modification of noncomplying measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Modify or eliminate any accounting principle or reporting requirement of such Federal agency which the agency determines fails to comply with the objectives and standards established under paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Inclusion of “off balance sheet” items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Develop and prescribe regulations which require that all assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, of insured depository institutions be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition, or other report of such institution, required to be filed with a Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform accounting of capital standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall maintain uniform accounting standards to be used for determining compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements of depository institutions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transition provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any standards in effect on December 19, 1991, under section 1833d <sup><a href="#1831n_1_target" name="1831n_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall continue in effect after December 19, 1991, until amended by the appropriate Federal banking agency under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports to banking committees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annual reports required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal banking agencies shall jointly submit an annual report to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing a description of any difference between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Explanation of reasons for discrepancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall contain an explanation of the reasons for any discrepancy between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each report under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide homeownership and rental housing opportunities for very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding and limitations of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Duration of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this section shall be effective, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), only during the 3-year period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual fiscal limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the provisions of this section shall apply only—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts for any losses resulting during the fiscal year from the sale of properties under this section, except that such amounts for losses may not exceed $30,000,000 in any fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent that amounts are provided in appropriations Acts pursuant to subparagraph (C) for any other costs relating to the program under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of losses resulting from the sale of properties under this section during any fiscal year shall be the amount equal to the sum of any affordable housing discounts reasonably anticipated to accrue during the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There are authorized to be appropriated, for each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), such sums as may be necessary for any costs of the program under this section other than losses resulting from the sale of properties under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Other definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Affordable housing discount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term “affordable housing discount” means, with respect to any eligible residential or eligible condominium property transferred under this section by the Corporation, the difference (if any) between the realizable disposition value of the property and the actual sale price of the property under this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Realizable disposition value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term “realizable disposition value” means the estimated sale price that the <!-- PDFPage:1143 -->Corporation reasonably would be able to obtain upon the sale of a property by the Corporation under the provisions of this chapter, not including this section, and any other applicable laws. Not later than the expiration of the 120-day period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), the Corporation shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, procedures for determining the realizable disposition value of a property transferred under this section, which shall take into consideration such factors as the Corporation considers appropriate, including the actual sale prices of properties disposed of by the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c) <sup><a href="#1831q_1_target" name="1831q_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the prices of other properties sold under similar programs, and the appraised value of the property transferred under this section. Until such procedures are established, the Corporation may consider the realizable disposition value of any eligible residential or condominium property to be equal to the appraised value of the property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Existing contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this section shall not apply to any eligible residential property or any eligible condominium property that is subject to an agreement entered into by the Corporation before the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) that provides for any other disposition of the property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules governing disposition of eligible single family properties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice to clearinghouses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to an eligible single family property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to clearinghouses. Such notice shall contain basic information about the property, including but not limited to location, condition, and information relating to the estimated fair market value of the property. Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to other public agencies, other nonprofit organizations, and qualifying households. The Corporation shall allow public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and qualifying households reasonable access to eligible single family property for purposes of inspection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offers to sell to nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and qualifying households</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation shall offer to sell the property to—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) public agencies or nonprofit organizations that agree to (i) make the property available for occupancy by and maintain it as affordable for low-income families (including low-income families with members who are veterans) for the remaining useful life of such property, or (ii) make the property available for purchase by any such family who, except as provided in paragraph (4), agrees to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months and certifies in writing that the family intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The restrictions described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument. If, upon the expiration of such 180-day period, no qualifying household, public agency, or nonprofit organization has made a bona fide offer to purchase the property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property to any purchaser. The Corporation shall actively market eligible single family properties for sale to low-income families and to low-income families with members who are veterans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recapture of profits from resale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (4), if any eligible single family property sold (A) to a qualifying household, or (B) to a low-income family pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(ii), subsection (j)(3)(A) of this section, or subsection (k)(2) of this section, is resold by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or low-income family, the Corporation shall recapture 75 percent of the amount of any proceeds from the resale that exceed the sum of (i) the original sale price for the acquisition of the property by the qualifying household or low-income family, (ii) the costs of any improvements to the property made after the date of the acquisition, and (iii) any closing costs in connection with the acquisition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exceptions to recapture requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Relocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may in its discretion waive the applicability (i) to any qualifying household of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the requirements relating to residency of a qualifying household under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (p)(12) of this section, and (ii) to any low-income family of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the residency requirements under paragraph (2)(B)(ii). The Corporation may grant any such waiver only for good cause shown, including any necessary relocation of the qualifying household or low-income family.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other recapture provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement under paragraph (3) shall not apply to any eligible single family property for which, upon resale by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, a portion of the sale proceeds or any subsidy provided in connection with the acquisition of the property by the household or family is required <!-- PDFPage:1144 -->to be recaptured or repaid under any other Federal, State, or local law (including <uscode detail="(m)" edition="2012" section="143" title="26">section 143(m) of title 26</uscode>) or regulation or under any sale agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exception to avoid displacement of existing residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (2), during the 180-day period following the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation may sell the property to the household residing in the property, but only if (A) such household was residing in the property at the time notice regarding the property was provided to clearinghouses under paragraph (1), (B) such sale is necessary to avoid the displacement of, and unnecessary hardship to, the resident household, (C) the resident household intends to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months, and (D) the resident household certifies in writing that the household intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules governing disposition of eligible multifamily housing properties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice to clearinghouses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to an eligible multifamily housing property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to clearinghouses.

Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to qualifying multifamily purchasers. The Corporation shall allow qualifying multifamily purchasers reasonable access to eligible multifamily housing properties for purposes of inspection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expression of serious interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Qualifying multifamily purchasers may give written notice of serious interest in a property during a period ending 90 days after the time the Corporation provides notice under paragraph (1). The notice of serious interest shall be in such form and include such information as the Corporation may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice of readiness for sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2) for a property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to any qualifying multifamily purchaser that has expressed serious interest in the property. Such notice shall specify the minimum terms and conditions for sale of the property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offers by qualifying multifamily purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose offer is accepted during the 45-day period to purchase the property before the expiration of the period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Extension of restricted offer periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may provide notice to clearinghouses regarding, and offer for sale under the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4), any eligible multifamily housing property—</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Aggregation requirements for multiproperty purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any purchase under paragraph (4) or (5) by a qualifying multifamily purchaser involving more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, with respect to which the purchaser intends to aggregate the low-income occupancy required under this paragraph over the total number of units so purchased—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) not less than 40 percent of the aggregate number of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income and very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the building or structure in which the units are located; provided that</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Financial infeasibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary or the State housing finance agency for the State in which an eligible multifamily housing property is located may temporarily reduce the low-income occupancy requirements under paragraph (7) applicable to the property, if the Secretary or such agency determines that an owner's compliance with such requirements is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return low-income occupancy to the level required under paragraph (7), and the Secretary or the State housing finance agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selling any eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of eligible residential properties, the Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers, to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy or purchase by very low-income and low-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest term.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiproperty purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers made under paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (d) of this section to purchase more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, to offers made by purchasers who agree to maintain low-income occupancy in each separate property purchased in compliance with the levels required for properties under subsection (d)(7)(A) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of substantially similar offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a given offer to purchase eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of such properties shall be considered to be substantially similar to another offer if the purchase price under such given offer is not less than 85 percent of the purchase price under the other offer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Financing sales</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assistance by Corporation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Sale price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall establish a market value for each eligible multifamily housing property. The Corporation shall sell eligible multifamily housing property at the net re<!-- PDFPage:1146 -->alizable market value, except that the Corporation may agree to sell eligible multifamily housing property at a price below the net realizable market value to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and enable a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to such property under subsection (d)(7) of this section. The Corporation may sell eligible single family property or eligible condominium property to qualifying households, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies without regard to any minimum sale price.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State election to prohibit interstate merger transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a merger transaction may not be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) if the transaction involves a bank the home State of which has enacted a law after September 29, 1994, and before June 1, 1997, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-State banks.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No effect on prior approvals of merger transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A law enacted by a State pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall have no effect on merger transactions that were approved before the effective date of such law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State election to permit early interstate merger transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A merger transaction may be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) before June 1, 1997, if the home State of each bank involved in the transaction has in effect, as of the date of the approval of such transaction, a law that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) expressly permits interstate merger transactions with all out-of-State banks.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain conditions allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A host State may impose conditions on a branch within such State of a bank resulting from an interstate merger transaction if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the conditions do not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or any subsidiary of such bank or company (other than on the basis of a nationwide reciprocal treatment requirement);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the imposition of the conditions is not preempted by Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the conditions do not apply or require performance after May 31, 1997.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Interstate merger transactions involving acquisitions of branches</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An interstate merger transaction may involve the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank only if the law of the State in which the branch is located permits out-of-State banks to acquire a branch of a bank in such State without acquiring the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of branch for purposes of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an interstate merger transaction which involves the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank, the branch shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an insured bank the home State of which is the State in which the branch is located.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Preservation of State age laws</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1) that would have the effect of permitting an out-of-State bank or out-of-State bank holding company to acquire a bank in a host State that has not been in existence for the minimum period of time, if any, specified in the statutory law of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for State age laws specifying a period of more than 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the responsible agency may approve a merger transaction pursuant to paragraph (1) involving the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence at least 5 years without regard to any longer minimum period of time specified in a statutory law of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Shell banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a bank that has been chartered solely for the purpose of, and does not open for business prior to, acquiring control of, or acquiring all or substan<!-- PDFPage:1159 -->tially all of the assets of, an existing bank or branch shall be deemed to have been in existence for the same period of time as the bank or branch to be acquired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Provisions relating to application and approval process</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Compliance with State filing requirements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any bank which files an application for an interstate merger transaction shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) comply with the filing requirements of any host State of the bank which will result from such transaction to the extent that the requirement—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks or out-of-State bank holding companies or subsidiaries of such banks or bank holding companies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is similar in effect to any requirement imposed by the host State on a nonbanking corporation incorporated in another State that engages in business in the host State; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) submit a copy of the application to the State bank supervisor of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Penalty for failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the applicant materially fails to comply with subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Concentration limits</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nationwide concentration limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the resulting bank (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the resulting bank), upon consummation of the transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Statewide concentration limits other than with respect to initial entries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any bank involved in the transaction (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of any such bank) has a branch in any State in which any other bank involved in the transaction has a branch; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the resulting bank (including all insured depository institutions which would be affiliates of the resulting bank), upon consummation of the transaction, would control 30 percent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in any such State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effectiveness of State deposit caps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the authority of any State to limit, by statute, regulation, or order, the percentage of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the State which may be held or controlled by any bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to the extent the application of such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Exceptions to subparagraph (B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section without regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with respect to any State if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a limitation described in subparagraph (C) in a State statute, regulation, or order which has the effect of permitting a bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to control a greater percentage of total deposits of all insured depository institutions in the State than the percentage permitted under subparagraph (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transaction is approved by the appropriate State bank supervisor of such State and the standard on which such approval is based does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception for certain banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply with respect to any interstate merger transaction involving only affiliated banks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Community reinvestment compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether to approve an application for an interstate merger transaction in which the resulting bank would have a branch or bank affiliate immediately following the transaction in any State in which the bank submitting the application (as the acquiring bank) had no branch or bank affiliate immediately before the transaction, the responsible agency shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comply with the responsibilities of the agency regarding such application under <uscode edition="2012" section="2903" title="12">section 2903 of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the most recent written evaluation under <uscode edition="2012" section="2903" title="12">section 2903 of this title</uscode> of any bank which would be an affiliate of the resulting bank; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the purchase of an insurance product from the institution or any of its affiliates; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an agreement by the consumer not to obtain, or a prohibition on the consumer from obtaining, an insurance product from an unaffiliated entity.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Adjustments for alternative methods of purchase</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standards that permit any person accepting deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in a depository institution to refer a customer who seeks to purchase any insurance product to a qualified person who sells such product, only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Qualification and licensing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standards prohibiting any depository institution from permitting any person to sell or offer for sale any insurance product in any part of any office of the institution, or on behalf of the institution, unless such person is appropriately qualified and licensed.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The prohibition contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to any life or health insurance product which is sold or offered for sale, as principal, agent, or broker, by any depository institution or any person who is engaged in such activities at an office of the institution or on behalf of the institution.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall conduct a bi-annual survey on efforts by insured depository institutions to bring those individuals and families who have rarely, if ever, held a checking account, a savings account or other type of transaction or check cashing account at an insured depository institution (hereafter in this section referred to as the “unbanked”) into the conventional finance system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors and questions to consider</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Whether a monthly statement itemizing all transactions for the monthly reporting period is made available to the depositor with respect to such account or a passbook is provided in which all transactions with respect to such account are recorded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The accounting principles applicable to the transfer of a small business loan or a lease of personal property with recourse contained in reports or statements required to be filed with Federal banking agencies by a qualified insured depository institution shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Capital and reserve requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the transfer of a small business loan or lease of personal property with recourse that is a sale under generally accepted accounting principles, each qualified insured depository institution shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish and maintain a reserve equal to an amount sufficient to meet the reasonable estimated liability of the institution under the recourse arrangement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include, for purposes of applicable capital standards and other capital measures, only the amount of the retained recourse in the risk-weighted assets of the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Qualified institutions criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An insured depository institution is a qualified insured depository institution for purposes of this section if, without regard to the accounting principles or capital requirements referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the institution is—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) well capitalized; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with the approval, by regulation or order, of the appropriate Federal banking agency, adequately capitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Aggregate amount of recourse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a qualified insured depository institution with respect to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property under subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not exceed—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 15 percent of the risk-based capital of the institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such greater amount, as established by the appropriate Federal banking agency by regulation or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Institutions that cease to be qualified or exceed aggregate limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an insured depository institution ceases to be a qualified insured depository institution or exceeds the limits under subsection (d) of this section, this section shall remain applicable to any transfers of small business loans or leases of personal property that occurred during the time that the institution was qualified and did not exceed such limit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prompt corrective action not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The capital of an insured depository institution shall be computed without regard to this section in determining whether the institution is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under <uscode edition="2012" section="1831o" title="12">section 1831o of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations required</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative system permitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the discretion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, this section shall not apply if the regulations of the agency provide that the aggregate amount of capital and reserves required with respect to the transfer of small business loans and leases of personal property with recourse does not exceed the aggregate amount of capital and reserves that would be required under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Existing transactions not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this section shall remain in effect with respect to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property with recourse by qualified insured depository institutions occurring before the effective date of regulations referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1835a. Prohibition against deposit production offices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall prescribe uniform regulations effective June 1, 1997, which prohibit any out-of-State bank from using any authority to engage in interstate branching pursuant to this title,<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law, primarily for the purpose of deposit production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines for meeting credit needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations issued under subsection (a) of this section shall include guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-State bank in a host State are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities which the branches serve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on out-of-State loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Regulations issued under subsection (a) of this section shall require that, beginning no earlier than 1 year after establishment or acquisition of an interstate branch or branches in a host State by an out-of-State bank, if the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank determines that the bank's level of lending in the host State relative to the deposits from the host State (as reasonably determinable from available information including the agency's sampling of the bank's loan files during an examination or such data as is otherwise available) is less than half the average of total loans in the host State relative to total deposits from the host State (as determinable from relevant sources) for all banks the home State of which is such State—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank shall review the loan portfolio of the bank and determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the agency determines that the out-of-State bank is not reasonably helping to meet those needs—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agency may order that an interstate branch or branches of such bank in the host State be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank has an acceptable plan that will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the out-of-State bank may not open a new interstate branch in the host State unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the interstate branch was acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the <!-- PDFPage:1182 -->nature of the acquired institution's business or loan portfolio;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank have a higher concentration of commercial or credit card lending, trust services, or other specialized activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the ratings received by the out-of-State bank under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [<uscode edition="2012" section="2901" title="12">12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.</uscode>];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) economic conditions, including the level of loan demand, within the communities served by the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the safe and sound operation and condition of the out-of-State bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Branch closing procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before exercising any authority under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall issue to the bank a notice of the agency's intention to close an interstate branch or branches and shall schedule a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><uscode detail="(h)" edition="2012" section="1818" title="12">Section 1818(h) of this title</uscode> shall apply to any proceeding brought under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply with respect to any interstate branch established or acquired in a host State pursuant to this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency, bank, State, and State bank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms “appropriate Federal banking agency”, “bank”, “State”, and “State bank” have the same meanings as in <uscode edition="2012" section="1813" title="12">section 1813 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Interstate branch</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term “interstate branch” means a branch established pursuant to this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title <sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law and any branch of a bank controlled by an out-of-State bank holding company (as defined in <uscode detail="(o)(7)" edition="2012" section="1841" title="12">section 1841(o)(7) of this title</uscode>).</p>
