<p class="statutory-body">The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to compete in international markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Small Business Administration, acting in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enhancing their ability to export;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) facilitating technology transfers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:601 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assistance programs authorized by <uscode detail="(i)" edition="2003" range="636(i) and 636(j)" section="636" title="15">sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title</uscode> are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by <uscode detail="(j)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(j) of this title</uscode>, the Congress finds—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode> can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) that the procurement authority under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode> shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by <uscode detail="(j)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(j) of this title</uscode> to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) with <sup><a href="#631_2_target" name="631_2">2</a></sup> respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is therefore the purpose of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode> to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement <sup><a href="#631_3_target" name="631_3">3</a></sup> assistance as may be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, <!-- PDFPage:602 -->supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering the disaster loan program authorized by <uscode edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636 of this title</uscode>, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Assistance to women owned business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) programs and activities designed to assist small business concerns owned and controlled by women must be implemented in such a way as to remove such discriminatory barriers while not adversely affecting the rights of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is, therefore, the purpose of those programs and activities conducted under the authority of this chapter that assist women entrepreneurs to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) vigorously promote the legitimate interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) remove, insofar as possible, the discriminatory barriers that are encountered by women in accessing capital and other factors of production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) require that the Government engage in a systematic and sustained effort to identify, define and analyze those discriminatory barriers facing women and that such effort directly involve the participation of women business owners in the public/private sector partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Prohibition on use of funds for individuals not lawfully within United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">None of the funds made available pursuant to this chapter may be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to any individual in the United States if the Administrator or the official to which the funds are made available receives notification that the individual is not lawfully within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Contract bundling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In complying with the statement of congressional policy expressed in subsection (a) of this section, relating to fostering the participation of small business concerns in the contracting opportunities of the Government, each Federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable, shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) comply with congressional intent to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy Statement</em>. It is the policy of the United States Government that all department and agency heads and all Federal employees involved in the procurement of any and all goods and services shall assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal procurement. The laws promote:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) [<uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="637" title="15">15 U.S.C. 637(a)</uscode>] Program, the Department of Defense Small and Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, and through other specific statutory authority or appropriate means;</p>

Department and agency heads are henceforth directed to execute, implement, and otherwise aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated procurement participation goals. In addition, all departments and agencies are encouraged to set reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory requirements, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(6) to the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of appropriations, providing funding or an outreach campaign for secondary workers (i.e., individuals indirectly affected by increased imports from other countries).</p>

Such payments shall be treated by the Department of the Treasury as interest income, not as retirement of indebtedness.</p>

Either of the said Secretaries may designate an officer of his Department, who has been appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to act in his stead as a member of the Loan Policy Board with respect to any matter or matters. The Loan Policy Board shall establish general policies (particularly with reference to the public interest involved in the granting and denial of applications for financial assistance by the Administration and with reference to the coordination of the functions of the Administration with other activities and policies of the Government), which shall govern the granting and denial of applications for financial assistance by the Administration.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Seal; appointment and compensation of personnel; use of other services and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall have power to adopt, alter, and use a seal, which shall be judicially noticed. The Administrator is authorized, subject to the civil service and classification laws, to select, employ, appoint, and fix the compensation of such officers, employees, attorneys, and agents as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter; to define their authority and duties; and to pay the costs of qualification of certain of them as notaries public. The Administration, with the consent of any board, commission, independent establishment, or executive department of the Government, may avail itself on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis of the use of information, services, facilities (including any field service thereof), officers, and employees thereof, in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Powers of Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this chapter the Administrator may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sue and be sued in any court of record of a State having general jurisdiction, or in any United States district court, and jurisdiction is conferred upon such district court to determine such controversies without regard to the amount in controversy; but no attachment, injunction, garnishment, or other similar process, mesne or final, shall be issued against the Administrator or his property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under regulations prescribed by him, assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of for cash or credit, in his discretion and upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of loans granted under this chapter, and to collect or compromise all obligations assigned to or held by him and all legal or equitable rights accruing to him in connection with the payment of such loans until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) deal with, complete, renovate, improve, modernize, insure, or rent, or sell for cash or credit upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, any real property conveyed to or otherwise acquired by him in connection with the payment of loans granted under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against third parties assigned to the Administrator in connection with loans made by him. This shall include authority to obtain deficiency judgments or otherwise in the case of mortgages assigned to the Administrator. <uscode edition="2003" section="5" title="41">Section 5 of title 41</uscode> shall not be construed to apply to any contract of hazard insurance or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of property obtained by the Administrator as a result of loans made under this chapter if the premium therefor or the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Administrator deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein acquired by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be exercised by the Administrator or by any officer or agent appointed by him without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Administrator from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer or agent he may appoint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquire, in any lawful manner, any property (real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), whenever deemed necessary or appropriate to the conduct of the activities authorized in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" range="636(a) and 636(b)" section="636" title="15">sections 636(a) and 636(b) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) make such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the authority vested in him by or pursuant to this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in addition to any powers, functions, privileges and immunities otherwise vested in him, take any and all actions (including the procurement of the services of attorneys by contract in any office where an attorney or attorneys are not or cannot be economically employed full time to render such services) when he determines such actions are necessary or desirable in making, servicing, compromising, modifying, liquidating, or otherwise dealing with or realizing on loans made under the provisions of this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to deferred participation loans, the Administrator may, in the discretion of and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Ad<!-- PDFPage:634 -->ministrator, authorize participating lending institutions to take actions relating to loan servicing on behalf of the Administrator, including determining eligibility and creditworthiness and loan monitoring, collection, and liquidation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) pay the transportation expenses and per diem in lieu of subsistence expenses, in accordance with subchapter I of <uscode chapter="57" edition="2003" title="5">chapter 57 of title 5</uscode>, for travel of any person employed by the Administration to render temporary services not in excess of six months in connection with any disaster referred to in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(b) of this title</uscode> from place of appointment to, and while at, the disaster area and any other temporary posts of duty and return upon completion of the assignment: <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator may extend the six-month limitation for an additional six months if the Administrator determines the extension is necessary to continue efficient disaster loan making activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) accept the services and facilities of Federal, State, and local agencies and groups, both public and private, and utilize such gratuitous services and facilities as may, from time to time, be necessary, to further the objectives of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(b) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) upon purchase by the Administration of any deferred participation entered into under <uscode edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636 of this title</uscode>, continue to charge a rate of interest not to exceed that initially charged by the participating institution on the amount so purchased for the remaining term of the indebtedness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether a recipient of or participant in any assistance under this chapter or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a recipient or participant, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) impose, retain, and use only those fees which are specifically authorized by law or which are in effect on September 30, 1994, and in the amounts and at the rates in effect on such date, except that the Administrator may, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, impose, retain, and utilize, additional fees—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed $100 for each loan servicing action (other than a loan assumption) requested after disbursement of the loan, including any substitution of collateral, release or substitution of a guarantor, reamortization, or similar action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed $300 for loan assumptions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed 1 percent of the amount of requested financings under title III of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [<uscode edition="2003" section="681" title="15">15 U.S.C. 681 et seq.</uscode>] for which the applicant requests a commitment from the Administration for funding during the following year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to recover the direct, incremental cost involved in the production and dissemination of compilations of information produced by the Administration under the authority of this chapter and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [<uscode edition="2003" section="661" title="15">15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.</uscode>]; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) collect, retain and utilize, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, any amounts collected by fiscal transfer agents and not used by such agent as payment of the cost of loan pooling or debenture servicing operations, except that amounts collected under this paragraph and paragraph (12) shall be utilized solely to facilitate the administration of the program that generated the excess amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procurement of experts and consultants; compensation and expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To such extent as he finds necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to procure the temporary (not in excess of one year) or intermittent services of experts or consultants or organizations thereof, including stenographic reporting services, by contract or appointment, and in such cases such services shall be without regard to the civil-service and classification laws and, except in the case of stenographic reporting services by organizations, without regard to <uscode edition="2003" section="5" title="41">section 5 of title 41</uscode>. Any individual so employed may be compensated at a rate not in excess of the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under <uscode edition="2003" section="5332" title="5">section 5332 of title 5</uscode>, including travel time, and, while such individual is away from his or her home or regular place of business, he or she may be allowed travel expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as authorized by <uscode edition="2003" section="5703" title="5">section 5703 of title 5</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Safety deposit box rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31 shall not apply to prepayments of rentals made by the <!-- PDFPage:635 -->Administration on safety deposit boxes used by the Administration for the safeguarding of instruments held as security for loans or for the safeguarding of other documents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undertaking or suspension of payment obligation; period; extension of maturity; repayment agreement; “required payments” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the requirements and conditions contained in this subsection, upon application by a small business concern which is the recipient of a loan made under this chapter, the Administration may undertake the small business concern's obligation to make the required payments under such loan or may suspend such obligation if the loan was a direct loan made by the Administration. While such payments are being made by the Administration pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration may undertake or suspend for a period of not to exceed 5 years any small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) without such undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become insolvent or remain insolvent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become or remain a viable small business entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the small business concern executes an agreement in writing satisfactory to the Administration as provided by paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of <uscode detail="(a)(4)(C)" edition="2003" range="636(a)(4)(C) and 636(i)(1)" section="636" title="15">sections 636(a)(4)(C) and 636(i)(1) of this title</uscode>, the Administration may extend the maturity of any loan on which the Administration undertakes or suspends the obligation pursuant to this subsection for a corresponding period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Prior to the undertaking or suspension by the Administration of any small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Administration, consistent with the purposes sought to be achieved herein, shall require the small business concern to agree in writing to repay to it the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which such obligation was undertaken or suspended, either—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Administration and the small business concern, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by a combination of the payments described in clause (i) and clause (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A), the Administration shall, prior to the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action, and require the small business concern to take such action as the Administration deems appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Administration deems necessary or appropriate to insure that the rights and interests of the lender (Small Business Administration or participant) will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The term “required payments” with respect to any loan means payments of principal and interest under the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Sale of guaranteed portion of loans by lender or subsequent holder; limitations; secondary market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The guaranteed portion of any loan made pursuant to this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, consistent with regulations on such sales as the Administration shall establish, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to the Administration's approval of the sale, or upon any subsequent resale, of any loan guaranteed by the Administration, if the lender certifies that such loan has been properly closed and that the lender has substantially complied with the provisions of the guarantee agreement and the regulations of the Administration, the Administration shall review and approve only materials not previously approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all fees due the Administration on a guaranteed loan shall have been paid in full prior to any sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each loan, except each loan made under <uscode detail="(a)(14)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(a)(14) of this title</uscode>, shall have been fully disbursed to the borrower prior to any sale.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Administration, and shall continue to service the loan in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administration shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for assessing the increase of small business access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations. Beginning on March 31, 1997, the sale of the unguaranteed portion of any loan made under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(a) of this title</uscode> shall not be permitted until a final regulation that applies uniformly to both depository institutions and other lenders is promulgated by the Administration setting forth the terms and conditions under which such sales can be permitted, including maintenance of appropriate reserve requirements and other safeguards to protect the safety and soundness of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(a) of this title</uscode>, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)(6)(C)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title</uscode> or subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:636 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Trust certificates; guarantee of timely payments of principal and interest; full faith and credit of United States; collection of fees; subrogation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administration is authorized to issue trust certificates representing ownership of all or a fractional part of the guaranteed portion of one or more loans which have been guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter, or under <uscode edition="2003" section="696" title="15">section 696 of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That such trust certificates shall be based on and backed by a trust or pool approved by the Administration and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Administration may collect a fee for any loan guarantee sold into the secondary market under subsection (f) of this section in an amount equal to not more than 50 percent of the portion of the sale price that exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan guaranteed by the Administration. Any such fee imposed by the Administration shall be collected by the Administration or by the agent which carries out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions required by subsection (h) of this section and shall be paid to the Administration and used solely to reduce the subsidy on loans guaranteed under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(a) of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That such fee shall not be charged to the borrower whose loan is guaranteed: and, <em>Provided further</em>, That nothing herein shall preclude any agent of the Administration from collecting a fee approved by the Administration for the functions described in subsection (h)(2) <sup><a href="#634_1_target" name="634_1">1</a></sup> of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administration is authorized to impose and collect, either directly or through a fiscal and transfer agent, a reasonable penalty on late payments of the fee authorized under subparagraph (A) in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of such fee per month plus interest.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procurement contracts; subcontracts to disadvantaged small business concerns; performance bonds; contract negotiations; definitions; eligibility; determinations; publication; recruitment; construction subcontracts; annual estimates; Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be the duty of the Administration and it is hereby empowered, whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to enter into contracts with the United States Government and any department, agency, or officer thereof having procurement powers obligating the Administration to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to the Government or to perform construction work for the Government. In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer's adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer's adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator's request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator's request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the department or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by <uscode detail="(j)(15)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(j)(15) of this title</uscode>, if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $5,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership De<!-- PDFPage:686 -->velopment, on a nondelegable basis, is authorized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of <uscode edition="2003" section="270a" title="40">section 270a of title 40</uscode>, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair market price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency.

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that a Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners are no longer economically disadvantaged for the purpose of receiving assistance under this subsection, the Program Participant shall be graduated pursuant to <uscode detail="(j)(10)(G)" edition="2003" section="636" title="15">section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title</uscode> subject to the right to a hearing as provided for under paragraph (9).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that funds or other assets have been withdrawn to the detriment of the Program Participant's business, the Administration shall—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the equity that disadvantaged owners have in their primary personal residences, except that any portion of such equity that is attributable to unduly excessive withdrawals from a Program Participant or a concern applying for program participation shall be taken into account.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) No small business concern shall be deemed eligible for any assistance pursuant to this subsection unless the Administration determines that with contract, financial, technical, and management support the small business concern will be able to perform contracts which may be awarded to such concern under paragraph (1)(C) and has reasonable prospects for success in competing in the private sector.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Limitations established by the Administration in its regulations and procedures restricting the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection to a limited number of standard industrial classification codes in an approved business plan shall not be applied in a manner that inhibits the logical business progression by a participating small business concern into areas of industrial endeavor where such concern has the potential for success.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) All determinations made pursuant to paragraph (5) with respect to whether a group has been subjected to prejudice or bias shall be made by the Administrator after consultation with the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development.

<p class="statutory-body">(10) The Administration shall develop and implement an outreach program to inform and recruit small business concerns to apply for eligibility for assistance under this subsection. Such program shall make a sustained and substantial effort to solicit applications for certification from small business concerns located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas and within States having relatively few Program Participants and from small disadvantaged business concerns in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the authority of this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§638. Research and development</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to small-business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist small-business concerns to obtain the benefits of research and development performed under Government contracts or at Government expense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide technical assistance to small-business concerns to accomplish the purposes of this section; and <sup><a href="#638_1_target" name="638_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses’ opportunities to respond to solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to report not less than annually to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate, and to the Committee on Science and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, on the SBIR and STTR programs of the Federal agencies and the Administration's information and monitoring efforts related to the SBIR and STTR programs, including the data on output and outcomes collected pursuant to subsections (g)(10), (<em>o</em>)(9), and (<em>o</em>)(15) of this section, the number of proposals received from, and the number and total amount of awards to, HUBZone small business concerns under each of the SBIR and STTR programs, and a description of the extent to which Federal agencies are providing in a timely manner information needed to maintain the database described in subsection (k) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation and cooperation with Government agencies; studies and recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration is authorized to consult and cooperate with all Government agencies and to make studies and recommendations to such agencies, and such agencies are authorized and directed to cooperate with the Administration in order to carry out and to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint programs; approval of agreements; withdrawal of approval; publication in Federal Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator is authorized to consult with representatives of small-business concerns with a view to assisting and encouraging such firms to undertake joint programs for research and development carried out through such corporate or other mechanism as may be most appropriate for the purpose.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to undertake and utilize applied research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to collect research information related to a particular industry and disseminate it to participating members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to conduct applied research on a protected, proprietary, and contractual basis with member or nonmember firms, Government agencies, and others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to prosecute applications for patents and render patent services for participating members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) to negotiate and grant licenses under patents held under the joint program, and to establish corporations designed to exploit particular patents obtained by it.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and with the prior written approval of the Attorney General, approve any agreement between small-business firms providing for a joint program of research and development, if the Administrator finds that the joint program proposed will maintain and strengthen the free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. The Administrator or the Attorney General may at any time withdraw his approval of the agreement and the joint program of research and development covered thereby, if he finds that the agreement or the joint program carried on under it is no longer in the best interests of the competitive free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. A copy of the statement of any such finding and approval intended to be within the coverage of this subsection, and a copy of any modification or withdrawal of approval, shall be published in the Federal Register. The authority conferred by this subsection on the Administrator shall not be delegated by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No act or omission to act pursuant to and within the scope of any joint program for research and development, under an agreement approved by the Administrator under this subsection, shall be construed to be within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws or the Federal <!-- PDFPage:712 -->Trade Commission Act [<uscode edition="2003" section="41" title="15">15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.</uscode>]. Upon publication in the Federal Register of the notice of withdrawal of his approval of the agreement granted under this subsection, either by the Administrator or by the Attorney General, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any subsequent act or omission to act by reason of such agreement or approval.</p>

It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after July 25, 1962, to provide additional authorization for such program on a two-year basis.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, or the solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as determined by the Administration, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects, or (5) why the agency has determined that the bundled contract (as defined in section 632(<em>o</em>) of this title) is necessary and justified. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the definition of a “United States industry” under the North American Industry Classification System, as established by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:733 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under <uscode edition="2003" section="694b" title="15">section 694b of this title</uscode>, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term “Committee” means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under <uscode edition="2003" section="46" title="41">section 46 of title 41</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term “public or private organization for the handicapped” has the same meaning given such term in <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2003" section="632" title="15">section 632(e) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term “handicapped individual” has the same meaning given such term in <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2003" section="632" title="15">section 632(f) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to <uscode edition="2003" section="47" title="41">section 47 of title 41</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. <uscode chapter="1" edition="2003" title="15">Chapter 1</uscode>) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by the various agencies having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Market research</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Quality improvements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:734 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Better terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Any other benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction of costs not determinative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Strategy specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the head of a contracting agency determines that a proposed procurement strategy for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the proposed procurement strategy shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify specifically the benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) set forth an assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements and specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include a specific determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contract teaming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small-business concern may submit an offer that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors for the performance of the contract. The head of the agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors. If a small business concern teams under this paragraph, it shall not affect its status as a small business concern for any other purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. <plaw congress="103" isprivate="false" number="355">Pub. L. 103–355,</plaw> title VII, §7101(a), Oct. 13, 1994, <statuteatlarge page="3367" volume="108">108 Stat. 3367</statuteatlarge></h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall annually establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service disabled <sup><a href="#644_1_target" name="644_1">1</a></sup> veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Governmentwide goal for participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall be established at not less than 1 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 1999, not less than 1.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2000, not less than 2 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2001, not less than 2.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2002, and not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2003 and each fiscal year thereafter. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the <!-- PDFPage:735 -->Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make consistent efforts to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts of the agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain such participation, shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eligible small business concerns under this section and under the program established under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Reports to Administration; submittal of information to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall report to the Administration on the extent of participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (including service-disabled veterans), qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Such reports shall contain appropriate justifications for failure to meet the goals established under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration shall annually compile and analyze the reports submitted by the individual agencies pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall submit them to the President and the Congress. The Administration's submission to the President shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Government-wide goals for participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women and the performance in attaining such goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The goals in effect for each agency and the agency's performance in attaining such goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An analysis of any failure to achieve the Government-wide goals or any individual agency goals and the actions planned by such agency (and approved by the Administration) to achieve the goals in the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The number and dollar value of contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women through—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) noncompetitive negotiation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) competition restricted to small business concerns, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) unrestricted competitions,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for each agency and on a Government-wide basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The number and dollar value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by women.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The President shall include the information required by paragraph (2) in each annual report to the Congress on the state of small business prepared pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="631b" title="15">section 631b(a) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small business set-asides</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter or any other provision of law precludes exclusive small business set-asides for procurements of architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation, and each Federal agency is authorized to develop such set-asides to further the interests of small business in those areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Small business reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contract for the purchase of goods and services that has an anticipated value greater than $2,500 but not greater than $100,000 shall be reserved exclusively for small business concerns unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive with market prices and are competitive with regard to the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a contracting officer shall consider a responsive offer timely received from an eligible small business offeror.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as precluding an award of a contract with a value not greater than $100,000 under the authority of subsection (a) of <uscode edition="2003" section="637" title="15">section 637 of this title</uscode>, <uscode edition="2003" section="2323" title="10">section 2323 of title 10</uscode>, section 712 of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (<plaw congress="100" isprivate="false" number="656">Public Law 100–656</plaw>; <uscode edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644 note</uscode>), or section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization; Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established in each Federal agency having procurement powers an office to <!-- PDFPage:736 -->be known as the “Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization”. The management of each such office shall be vested in an officer or employee of such agency who shall—</p>

The breakout procurement center representative shall carry out the activities described in paragraph (2), and shall be an advocate for the breakout of items for procurement through full and open competition, whenever appropriate, while maintaining the integrity of the system in which such items are used, and an advocate for the use of full and open competition, whenever appropriate, for the procurement of supplies and services by such center. Any breakout procurement center representative assigned under this subsection shall be in addition to the representative referred to in subsection (k)(6) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to carrying out the responsibilities assigned by the Administration, a breakout procurement center representative is authorized to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) attend any provisioning conference or similar evaluation session during which determinations are made as to whether requirements are to be procured through other than full and open competition and make recommendations with respect to such requirements to the members of such conference or session;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) review, at any time, restrictions on competition previously imposed on items through acquisition method coding or similar procedures, and recommend to personnel of the appropriate activity the prompt reevaluation of such limitations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) receive unsolicited engineering proposals and, when appropriate (i) conduct a value analysis of such proposal to determine whether such proposal, if adopted, will result in lower costs to the United States without substantially impeding legitimate acquisition objectives and forward to personnel of the appropriate activity recommendations with respect to such proposal, or (ii) forward such proposals without analysis to personnel of the activity responsible for reviewing such proposals and who shall furnish the breakout procurement center representative with information regarding the disposition of any such proposal; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:737 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) review the systems that account for the acquisition and management of technical data within the procurement center to assure that such systems provide the maximum availability and access to data needed for the preparation of offers to sell to the United States those supplies to which such data pertain which potential offerors are entitled to receive.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A breakout procurement center representative is authorized to appeal the failure to act favorably on any recommendation made pursuant to paragraph (2). Such appeal shall be filed and processed in the same manner and subject to the same conditions and limitations as an appeal filed by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Administration shall assign and co-locate at least two small business technical advisers to each major procurement center in addition to such other advisers as may be authorized from time to time.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administration shall establish personnel positions for breakout procurement representatives and advisers assigned pursuant to this subsection, which are classified at a grade level of the General Schedule sufficient to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term “major procurement center” means a procurement center that, in the opinion of the Administrator, purchases substantial dollar amounts of other than commercial items and which has the potential to incur significant savings as the result of the placement of a breakout procurement center representative.</p>

<p class="note-body">“This title [amending <uscode edition="2003" section="632" title="15">section 632 of this title</uscode> and section 541 of former Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works [now <uscode edition="2003" section="1102" title="40">40 U.S.C. 1102</uscode>], enacting provisions set out as notes under <uscode edition="2003" range="632 and 644" section="632" title="15">sections 632 and 644 of this title</uscode>, and amending provisions set out as a note under <uscode edition="2003" section="644" title="15">section 644 of this title</uscode>] may be cited as the ‘Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988’.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 702. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) many small business concerns have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to fulfill a broad range of Government requirements for products, services (including research, development, technical, and professional services), and construction, through the Federal procurement process;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) various Congressional mandated reforms to the Federal procurement process, including the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 [<plaw congress="98" isprivate="false" number="369">Pub. L. 98–369,</plaw> div. B, title VII, see Tables for classification], the Defense Procurement Reform Act of 1984 [<plaw congress="98" isprivate="false" number="525">Pub.

L. 98–577,</plaw> see Tables for classification], were designed to eliminate obstacles to competition and thereby to broaden small business participation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) traditional agency efforts to implement the mandate for small business participation in a fair proportion of Federal procurements as required by section 15(a) of the Small Business Act [<uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(a)</uscode>] have resulted in—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) a concentration of procurement contract awards in a limited number of industry categories, often dominated by small business concerns, through the use of set-asides, for the purpose of assuring the attainment of the agency's overall small business contracting goals; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) inadequate efforts to expand small business participation in agency procurements of products or services which have historically demonstrated low rates of small business participation despite substantial potential for expanded small business participation.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 711. SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.—There is established a Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (hereafter referred to in this title as ‘the Program’) pursuant to section 15 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (<uscode edition="2003" section="413" title="41">41 U.S.C. 413</uscode>) to provide for the testing of innovative procurement methods and procedures. The Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy shall designate the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as the executive agent responsible for conducting the test.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.—The purposes of the Program are to demonstrate whether—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) the competitive capabilities of small business firms in certain industry categories will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis for Federal contracting opportunities,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) the use of targeted goaling and management techniques by procuring agencies, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, can expand small business participation in Federal contracting opportunities which have been historically low, despite adequate numbers of qualified small business contractors in the economy, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) expanded use of full and open competition, as specified by the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (<uscode detail="(3)" edition="2003" section="2302" title="10">10 U.S.C. 2302(3) and </uscode><uscode detail="(7)" edition="2003" section="403" title="41">41 U.S.C. 403(7)</uscode>), adversely affects small business participation in certain industry categories, taking into consideration the numerical dominance of small firms, the size and scope of most contracting opportunities, and the competitive capabilities of small firms.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(c) <cap-smallcap>Program Term</cap-smallcap>.—The Program shall commence on January 1, 1989.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.—The Program shall apply to contract solicitations for the procurement of services in industry groups designated in section 717.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 712. ENHANCED SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION GOALS.</h4>

In attaining its small business participation goal for contract awards for each of the designated industry groups, each participating agency shall make a good faith effort to assure that emerging small business concerns are awarded not less than 15 percent of the dollar value of the contract awards for each of the designated industry groups.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Special Assistance for Emerging Small Business Concerns.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) <cap-smallcap>Small business reserve</cap-smallcap>.—During the term of the Program, all contract opportunities in the industry groups designated in section 717 shall be reserved for exclusive competition among emerging small business concerns in accordance with the competition standard specified in section 15(j) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(j)" edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(j)</uscode>), if the estimated award value of the contract is equal to or less than the greater of:</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) such larger dollar amount established pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) <cap-smallcap>Adjustments to the small business reserve</cap-smallcap>.—If the goal of awarding emerging small business concerns 15 percent of the total dollar value of contracts in a designated industry category is determined not to have been attained, upon the review of award data conducted in accordance with subsection (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, to ensure attainment of such goal, shall prescribe, on a semiannual basis, appropriate adjustments to the dollar threshold for contract opportunities in such designated industry category below which competition shall be conducted exclusively among emerging small business concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) <cap-smallcap>Small business small purchase reserve</cap-smallcap>.—The requirements of this subsection dealing with the reserve amount shall apply notwithstanding the amount specified in section 15(j) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(j)" edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(j)</uscode>).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of modifications to existing contracts above the small purchase threshold</cap-smallcap>.—Any modification or follow-on award to a contract having an initial award value in excess of $25,000 shall not be subject to the limitations on competition required by this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(c) <cap-smallcap>Targeting Industry Categories With Limited Small Business Participation</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Concurrent with the term of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, the head of each participating agency shall implement a program to expand small business participation in the agency's acquisition of selected products and services in 10 industry categories which have historically demonstrated low rates of small business participation. The products and services to be targeted for the small business participation expansion program and the special goals for such program, shall be developed in conjunction with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and shall be subject to the requirements of section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(g)" edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(g)</uscode>).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:746 --><p class="note-body">“(2) The products or services selected for the small business participation expansion program shall be drawn from industry categories that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) are the recipients of substantial purchases by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(B) have less than 10 percent of such annual purchases made from small business concerns; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(C) have significant amounts of small business productive capacity that have not been utilized by the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(3) In developing its small business participation expansion program, each participating agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) prepare, and furnish to the Administration, a detailed, time-phased strategy (with incremental numerical goals); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(B) encourage and promote joint ventures, teaming agreements and other similar arrangements, which permit small business concerns to effectively compete for contract solicitations for which an individual small business concern would lack the requisite capacity or capability needed to establish responsibility for the award of a contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(d) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring Agency Performance.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) Participating agencies shall monitor the attainment of their small business participation goals on an annual basis.

Any regulatory requirements which are inconsistent with this provision shall be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Restricted Competition</cap-smallcap>.—If a participating agency has failed to attain its small business participation goal under section 712(a), subsequent contracting opportunities, which are in excess of the reserve thresholds specified pursuant to section 712(b) shall be solicited through a competition restricted to eligible small business concerns pursuant to section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(a)" edition="2003" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(a)</uscode>) only at those buying activities of the participating agency that failed to attain the small business participation goal required by section 712(a).

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses.

The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses.

The Administration shall require any applicant for a small business development center grant with performance commencing on or after <!-- PDFPage:755 -->January 1, 1992 to have its own budget and to primarily utilize institutions of higher education and women's business centers operating pursuant to <uscode edition="2003" section="656" title="15">section 656 of this title</uscode> to provide services to the small business community. The term of such grants shall be made on a calendar year basis or to coincide with the Federal fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Small Business Development Centers shall work in close cooperation with the Administration's regional and local offices, the Department of Commerce, appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and the small business community to serve as an active information dissemination and service delivery mechanism for existing trade promotion, trade finance, trade adjustment, trade remedy and trade data collection programs of particular utility for small businesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Small Business Development Center Program shall be under the general management and oversight of the Administration for the delivery of programs and services to the small business community. Such programs and services shall be jointly developed, negotiated, and agreed upon, with full participation of both parties, pursuant to an executed cooperative agreement between the Small Business Development Center applicant and the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(A) Small business development centers are authorized to form an association to pursue matters of common concern. If more than a majority of the small business development centers which are operating pursuant to agreements with the Administration are members of such an association, the Administration is authorized and directed to recognize the existence and activities of such an association and to consult with it and develop documents (i) announcing the annual scope of activities pursuant to this section, (ii) requesting proposals to deliver assistance as provided in this section and (iii) governing the general operations and administration of the Small Business Development Center Program, specifically including the development of regulations and a uniform negotiated cooperative agreement for use on an annual basis when entering into individual negotiated agreements with small business development centers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) If the pro rata amount calculated under subclause (I) for any State is less than the minimum funding level under clause (iii), the Administration shall determine the aggregate amount necessary to achieve that minimum funding level for each such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The aggregate amount calculated under subclause (II) shall be deducted from the amount calculated under subclause (I) for States eligible to receive more than the minimum funding level.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The aggregate amount deducted under subclause (III) shall be added to the grants of those States that are not eligible to receive more than the minimum funding level in order to achieve the minimum funding level for each such State, except that the eligible amount of a grant to any State shall not be reduced to an amount below the minimum funding level.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Grant determination</cap-smallcap>.—The amount of a grant that a State is eligible to apply for under this subparagraph shall be the amount determined under clause (i), subject to any modifications required under clause (iii), and shall be based on the amount available for the fiscal year in which performance of the grant commences, but not including amounts distributed in accordance with clause (iv). The amount of a grant received by a State under any provision of this subparagraph shall not exceed the amount of matching funds from sources other than the Federal Government, as required under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Minimum funding level</cap-smallcap>.—The amount of the minimum funding level for each State <!-- PDFPage:756 -->shall be determined for each fiscal year based on the amount made available for that fiscal year to carry out this section, as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) If the amount made available is less than $81,500,000, the minimum funding level shall be the remainder of $500,000 minus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available is less than $81,500,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) If the amount made available is more than $90,000,000, the minimum funding level shall be the sum of $500,000 plus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available exceeds $90,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Distributions</cap-smallcap>.—Subject to clause (iii), if any State does not apply for, or use, its full funding eligibility for a fiscal year, the Administration shall distribute the remaining funds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) If the grant to any State is less than the amount received by that State in fiscal year 2000, the Administration shall distribute such remaining funds, on a pro rata basis, based on the percentage of shortage of each such State, as compared to the total amount of such remaining funds available, to the extent necessary in order to increase the amount of the grant to the amount received by that State in fiscal year 2000, or until such funds are exhausted, whichever first occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) If any funds remain after the application of subclause (I), the remaining amount may be distributed as supplemental grants to any State, as the Administration determines, in its discretion, to be appropriate, after consultation with the association referred to in subsection (a)(3)(A) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) <cap-smallcap>Exclusions</cap-smallcap>.—Grants provided to a State by the Administration or another Federal agency to carry out subsection (a)(6) or (c)(3)(G) of this section, or for supplemental grants set forth in clause (iv)(II) of this subparagraph, shall not be included in the calculation of maximum funding for a State under clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
