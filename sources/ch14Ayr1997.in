<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to compete in international markets</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Small Business Administration, acting in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enhancing their ability to export;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) facilitating technology transfers;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assistance programs authorized by <uscode detail="(i)" edition="1997" range="636(i) and 636(j)" section="636" title="15">sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title</uscode> are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by <uscode detail="(j)" edition="1997" section="636" title="15">section 636(j) of this title</uscode>, the Congress finds—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_iv"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup></p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_v"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode> can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A_vi"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) that the procurement authority under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="637" title="15">section 637(a) of this title</uscode> shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by <uscode detail="(j)" edition="1997" section="636" title="15">section 636(j) of this title</uscode> to—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_B_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; purpose</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) with <sup><a href="#631_2_target" name="631_2">2</a></sup> respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_G"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2"></a>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to enforce rigorously the letter and spirit of public laws that promote increased participation in Federal procurement by Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals (SDBs) as described in section 8 of the Small Business Act (<uscode edition="1997" section="637" title="15">15 U.S.C. 637</uscode>), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as described in 34 C.F.R. 608.2, and Minority Institutions (MIs) as referred to in sections 1046(3) and 316(b)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (<uscode detail="(3)" edition="1997" range="1135d-5(3) and 1059c(b)(1)," section="1135d-5" title="20">20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3) and 1059c(b)(1), </uscode>respectively), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy Statement</i>. It is the policy of the United States Government that all department and agency heads and all Federal employees involved in the procurement of any and all goods and services shall assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal procurement. The laws promote:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<p class="note-body">(a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) [<uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="637" title="15">15 U.S.C. 637(a)</uscode>] Program, the Department of Defense Small and Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, and through other specific statutory authority or appropriate means;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<p class="note-body">(b) the establishment of particular goals for SDBs, HBCUs, or MIs on an agency-by-agency basis and the requirement that prime contractors and other recipients of Federal funds attain similar goals in their procurement; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<p class="note-body">(c) the establishment of other mechanisms that ensure that SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs have a fair opportunity to participate in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Attainment of Goals</i>. All departments and agencies are required by law to establish participation goals of not less than 5 percent (<uscode detail="(g)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(g)</uscode>) or a greater percentage where otherwise required by law, as further provided in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 91–1 of March 11, 1991. Although the Federal Government has made substantial strides toward meeting established SDB, HBCU, and MI participation goals, certain departments and agencies have from time to time failed to aggressively pursue such goals. Department and agency heads are henceforth directed to execute, implement, and otherwise aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated procurement participation goals. In addition, all departments and agencies are encouraged to set reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory requirements, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Subcontracting Plans</i>. The Small Business Act, (<uscode detail="(d)" edition="1997" section="637" title="15">15 U.S.C. 637(d)</uscode>) and other related laws require certain prime contractors to maximize the use of SDBs in subcontracting plans and strive to achieve stated goals through prime contractors&amp;apos; subcontracting practices. Department and agency heads are directed to aggressively enforce these prime contractors&amp;apos; obligations to maximize awards of subcontracts to eligible SDBs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization ("OSDBU").</i></p>
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<p class="note-body">(a) Section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(k)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(k)</uscode>) establishes in each Federal department and agency an OSDBU and requires that the Director of the OSDBU "be responsible only to, and report directly to, the head of such agency or to the deputy of such head" (<uscode detail="(k)(3)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(k)(3)</uscode>). To the extent not prohibited by law, each department and agency shall ensure that the aforementioned direct reporting requirements are henceforth vigorously enforced.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<p class="note-body">(b) Because of the importance of the OSDBU function, each department and agency shall also, to the extent not prohibited by law, comply with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 79–1 of March 7, 1979, which provides implementation guidance on section 15k [15(k)] and the organizational placement and functions of the OSDBU.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Anti-fraud Enforcement</i>. All department and agency heads shall ensure that in enforcing the laws and requirements mentioned in this order, Federal benefits or contracts intended for SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs are not awarded to entities that are not legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Department and agency anti-fraud enforcement, however, shall not diminish agency vigor in achieving the aforementioned participation goals, which exist to promote the development of legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Nothing herein is intended to change self-certification requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>Periodic Reports to the President</i>. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall report to the President periodically on the progress of all departments and agencies in complying with the laws and requirements mentioned in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <i>Independent Agencies</i>. Independent agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. This order shall be effective immediately.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) although some progress has resulted from the Program, it has generally failed to meet its objectives, which remain as valid now as when the Program was initiated;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) the Administration has often not efficiently and equitably administered and managed the Program in a manner that provided clear lines of responsibility for implementing and monitoring many of the administrative duties under the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) the Administration and some program participants have given insufficient attention and support to the business development goals of the Program and instead have focused almost entirely on the size of contract awards or the number of firms certified to participate in the Program;</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to small-business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer pilot programs;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses&amp;apos; opportunities to respond to solicitations;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to report not less than annually to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives on the SBIR and STTR programs of the Federal agencies and the Administration's information and monitoring efforts related to the SBIR and STTR programs.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint programs; approval of agreements; withdrawal of approval; publication in Federal Register</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator is authorized to consult with representatives of small-business concerns with a view to assisting and encouraging such firms to undertake joint programs for research and development carried out through such corporate or other mechanism as may be most appropriate for the purpose. Such joint programs may, among other things, include the following purposes:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to construct, acquire, or establish laboratories and other facilities for the conduct of research;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to undertake and utilize applied research;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to collect research information related to a particular industry and disseminate it to participating members;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and with the prior written approval of the Attorney General, approve any agreement between small-business firms providing for a joint program of research and development, if the Administrator finds that the joint program proposed will maintain and strengthen the free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. The Administrator or the Attorney General may at any time withdraw his approval of the agreement and the joint program of research and development covered thereby, if he finds that the agreement or the joint program carried on under it is no longer in the best interests of the competitive free enterprise system and the economy of the Nation. A copy of the statement of any such finding and approval intended to be within the coverage of this subsection, and a copy of any modification or withdrawal of approval, shall be published in the Federal Register. The authority conferred by this subsection on the Administrator shall not be delegated by him.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No act or omission to act pursuant to and within the scope of any joint program for research and development, under an agreement approved by the Administrator under this subsection, shall be construed to be within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act [<uscode edition="1997" section="41" title="15">15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.</uscode>]. Upon publication in the Federal Register of the notice of withdrawal of his approval of the agreement granted under this subsection, either by the Administrator or by the Attorney General, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any subsequent act or omission to act by reason of such agreement or approval.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the regular business loan program of the Small Business Administration should be reviewed by the Congress at least once every two years. It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after July 25, 1962, to provide additional authorization for such program on a two-year basis.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§644. Awards or contracts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, or the solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as determined by the Administration, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects, or (5) why the agency has determined that the bundled contract (as defined in <uscode detail="(o)" edition="1997" section="632" title="15">section 632(o) of this title</uscode>) is necessary and justified. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the four-digit standard industrial classification codes contained in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under <uscode edition="1997" section="694b" title="15">section 694b of this title</uscode>, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term "Committee" means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under <uscode edition="1997" section="46" title="41">section 46 of title 41</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term "public or private organization for the handicapped" has the same meaning given such term in <uscode detail="(e)" edition="1997" section="632" title="15">section 632(e) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term "handicapped individual" has the same meaning given such term in <uscode detail="(f)" edition="1997" section="632" title="15">section 632(f) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to <uscode edition="1997" section="47" title="41">section 47 of title 41</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. <uscode chapter="1" edition="1997" title="15">Chapter 1</uscode>) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by the various agencies having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Market research</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_A"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Cost savings.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Quality improvements.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B_iv"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Better terms and conditions.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B_v"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Any other benefits.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_C"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction of costs not determinative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Strategy specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the head of a contracting agency determines that a proposed procurement strategy for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the proposed procurement strategy shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify specifically the benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) set forth an assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements and specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include a specific determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contract teaming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small-business concern may submit an offer that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors for the performance of the contract. The head of the agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors. If a small business concern teams under this paragraph, it shall not affect its status as a small business concern for any other purpose.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall annually establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. The Governmentwide goal for participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall be established at not less than 1 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 1999, not less than 1.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2000, not less than 2 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2001, not less than 2.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2002, and not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2003 and each fiscal year thereafter. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make consistent efforts to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts of the agency, including participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain such participation, shall consider—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2_B"></a>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 702. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) many small business concerns have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to fulfill a broad range of Government requirements for products, services (including research, development, technical, and professional services), and construction, through the Federal procurement process;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) various Congressional mandated reforms to the Federal procurement process, including the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 [<plaw congress="98" isprivate="false" number="369">Pub. L. 98–369,</plaw> div. B, title VII, see Tables for classification], the Defense Procurement Reform Act of 1984 [<plaw congress="98" isprivate="false" number="525">Pub.

L. 98–577,</plaw> see Tables for classification], were designed to eliminate obstacles to competition and thereby to broaden small business participation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) traditional agency efforts to implement the mandate for small business participation in a fair proportion of Federal procurements as required by section 15(a) of the Small Business Act [<uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(a)</uscode>] have resulted in—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(A) a concentration of procurement contract awards in a limited number of industry categories, often dominated by small business concerns, through the use of set-asides, for the purpose of assuring the attainment of the agency's overall small business contracting goals; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(B) inadequate efforts to expand small business participation in agency procurements of products or services which have historically demonstrated low rates of small business participation despite substantial potential for expanded small business participation.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">"part b—demonstration program</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 711. SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.—There is established a Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (hereafter referred to in this title as &amp;apos;the Program&amp;apos;) pursuant to section 15 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (<uscode edition="1997" section="413" title="41">41 U.S.C. 413</uscode>) to provide for the testing of innovative procurement methods and procedures. The Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy shall designate the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as the executive agent responsible for conducting the test.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.—The purposes of the Program are to demonstrate whether—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) the competitive capabilities of small business firms in certain industry categories will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis for Federal contracting opportunities,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) the use of targeted goaling and management techniques by procuring agencies, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, can expand small business participation in Federal contracting opportunities which have been historically low, despite adequate numbers of qualified small business contractors in the economy, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) expanded use of full and open competition, as specified by the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (<uscode detail="(3)" edition="1997" section="2302" title="10">10 U.S.C. 2302(3) and </uscode><uscode detail="(7)" edition="1997" section="403" title="41">41 U.S.C. 403(7)</uscode>), adversely affects small business participation in certain industry categories, taking into consideration the numerical dominance of small firms, the size and scope of most contracting opportunities, and the competitive capabilities of small firms.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(c) <cap-smallcap>Program Term</cap-smallcap>.—The Program shall commence on January 1, 1989.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.—The Program shall apply to contract solicitations for the procurement of services in industry groups designated in section 717.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 712. ENHANCED SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION GOALS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Enhanced Goals for Designated Industry Groups</cap-smallcap>.—Each participating agency shall establish an annual small business participation goal that is 40 percent of the dollar value of the contract awards for each of the designated industry groups. In attaining its small business participation goal for contract awards for each of the designated industry groups, each participating agency shall make a good faith effort to assure that emerging small business concerns are awarded not less than 15 percent of the dollar value of the contract awards for each of the designated industry groups.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Special Assistance for Emerging Small Business Concerns.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) <cap-smallcap>Small business reserve</cap-smallcap>.—During the term of the Program, all contract opportunities in the industry groups designated in section 717 shall be reserved for exclusive competition among emerging small business concerns in accordance with the competition standard specified in section 15(j) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(j)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(j)</uscode>), if the estimated award value of the contract is equal to or less than the greater of:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(A) $25,000, or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(B) such larger dollar amount established pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) <cap-smallcap>Adjustments to the small business reserve</cap-smallcap>.—If the goal of awarding emerging small business concerns 15 percent of the total dollar value of contracts in a designated industry category is determined not to have been attained, upon the review of award data conducted in accordance with subsection (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, to ensure attainment of such goal, shall prescribe, on a semiannual basis, appropriate adjustments to the dollar threshold for contract opportunities in such designated industry category below which competition shall be conducted exclusively among emerging small business concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) <cap-smallcap>Small business small purchase reserve</cap-smallcap>.—The requirements of this subsection dealing with the reserve amount shall apply notwithstanding the amount specified in section 15(j) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(j)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(j)</uscode>).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of modifications to existing contracts above the small purchase threshold</cap-smallcap>.—Any modification or follow-on award to a contract having an initial award value in excess of $25,000 shall not be subject to the limitations on competition required by this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(c) <cap-smallcap>Targeting Industry Categories With Limited Small Business Participation</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Concurrent with the term of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, the head of each participating agency shall implement a program to expand small business participation in the agency's acquisition of selected products and services in 10 industry categories which have historically demonstrated low rates of small business participation. The products and services to be targeted for the small business participation expansion program and the special goals for such program, shall be developed in conjunction with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and shall be subject to the requirements of section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(g)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(g)</uscode>).</p>
<p class="note-body">"(2) The products or services selected for the small business participation expansion program shall be drawn from industry categories that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(A) are the recipients of substantial purchases by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(B) have less than 10 percent of such annual purchases made from small business concerns; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(C) have significant amounts of small business productive capacity that have not been utilized by the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(3) In developing its small business participation expansion program, each participating agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(A) prepare, and furnish to the Administration, a detailed, time-phased strategy (with incremental numerical goals); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(B) encourage and promote joint ventures, teaming agreements and other similar arrangements, which permit small business concerns to effectively compete for contract solicitations for which an individual small business concern would lack the requisite capacity or capability needed to establish responsibility for the award of a contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(d) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring Agency Performance.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) Participating agencies shall monitor the attainment of their small business participation goals on an annual basis. An annual review by each participating agency shall be completed not later than January 31 of each year, based on the data for the preceding fiscal year, from October 1 through September 30.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) All awards to small business concerns (including small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals) shall be counted toward attainment of the goals specified in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) Modifications to a participating agency's solicitation practices, pursuant to section 713(b), shall be made at the beginning of the fiscal year quarter following each review, if the rate of small business participation is less than 40 percent of the contract awards.</p>

Any regulatory requirements which are inconsistent with this provision shall be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Restricted Competition</cap-smallcap>.—If a participating agency has failed to attain its small business participation goal under section 712(a), subsequent contracting opportunities, which are in excess of the reserve thresholds specified pursuant to section 712(b) shall be solicited through a competition restricted to eligible small business concerns pursuant to section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="644" title="15">15 U.S.C. 644(a)</uscode>) only at those buying activities of the participating agency that failed to attain the small business participation goal required by section 712(a).

Such modifications in the participating agency's solicitation practices shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later than the beginning of the quarter following completion of the review made pursuant to section 712(d) indicating that changes to solicitation practices are required.</p>

Such reserve amount shall be established by the Administrator at the start of the program at a level which can reasonably be expected to result in the Department attaining the applicable participation goal for emerging small business concerns. Such reserve threshold shall be reviewed by the Secretary and adjusted by the Administrator to the extent necessary on a semiannual basis beginning after the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 1989 on the basis of the aggregate of contract awards for the four fiscal year quarters preceding the date of the review.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">"(B) foster joint ventures, teaming agreements, and other similar arrangements, which permit small business concerns to effectively compete for contract opportunities for which an individual firm would lack the requisite capacity or capability needed to establish responsibility for the award of a contract; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(C) foster subcontracting through plans negotiated and enforced pursuant to section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (<uscode detail="(d)" edition="1997" section="637" title="15">15 U.S.C. 637(d)</uscode>) or solicitation requirements specifying minimum percentages of subcontracting for the purpose of determining the responsiveness of an offer.</p>
