<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) it is appropriate for the Congress to require by law the completion of the research described in the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety and an assessment of the practicability of developing a performance standard to reduce cigarette ignition propensity, and</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commission or its representative under this Act which information contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to in <uscode edition="2011" section="1905" title="18">section 1905 of title 18</uscode> or subject to <uscode detail="(b)(4)" edition="2011" section="552" title="5">section 552(b)(4) of title 5</uscode> shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall, prior to the disclosure of any information which will permit the public to ascertain readily the identity of a manufacturer or private labeler of a consumer product, offer such manufacturer or private labeler an opportunity to mark such information as confidential and therefore barred from disclosure under paragraph (2). A manufacturer or private labeler shall submit any such mark within 15 calendar days after the date on which it receives the Commission's offer.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All information that a manufacturer or private labeler has marked to be confidential and barred from disclosure under paragraph (2), either at the time of submission or pursuant to paragraph (3), shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the procedures established in paragraphs (5) and (6).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Commission determines that a document marked as confidential by a manufacturer or private labeler to be barred from disclosure under paragraph (2) may be disclosed because it is not confidential information as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall notify such person in writing that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 10 days after the date of receipt of notification.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any person receiving such notification may, if he believes such disclosure is barred by paragraph (2), before the date set for release of the document, bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place or business, or in which the documents are located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to restrain disclosure of the document. Any person receiving such notification may file with the appropriate district court or court of appeals of the United States, as appropriate, an application for a stay of disclosure. The documents shall not be disclosed until the court has ruled on the application for a stay.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this Act shall authorize the withholding of information by the Commission or any officer or employee under its control from the duly authorized committees or subcommittees of the Congress, and the provisions of paragraphs (2) through (6) shall not apply to such disclosures, except that the Commission shall immediately notify the manufacturer or private labeler of any such request for information designated as confidential by the manufacturer or private labeler.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_8"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The provisions of paragraphs (2) through (6) shall not prohibit the disclosure of information to other officers, employees, or representatives of the Commission (including contractors) concerned with carrying out this Act or when relevant in any administrative proceeding under this Act or in judicial proceedings to which the Commission is a party.

<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection, not less than 15 days prior to its public disclosure of any information obtained under this Act, or to be disclosed to the public in connection therewith (unless the Commission publishes a finding that the public health and safety requires a lesser period of notice), the Commission shall, to the extent practicable, notify and provide a summary of the information to, each manufacturer or private labeler of any consumer product to which such information pertains, if the manner in which such consumer product is to be designated or described in such information will permit the public to ascertain readily the identity of such manufacturer or private labeler, and shall provide such manufacturer or private labeler with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments to the Commission in regard to such information. The Commission shall take reasonable steps to assure, prior to its public disclosure thereof, that information from which the identity of such manufacturer or private labeler may be readily ascertained is accurate, and that such disclosure is fair in the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of this Act. In disclosing any information under this subsection, the Commission may, and upon the request of the manufacturer or private labeler shall, include with the disclosure any comments or other information or a summary thereof submitted by such manufacturer or private labeler to the extent permitted by and subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that a document claimed to be inaccurate by a manufacturer or private labeler under paragraph (1) should be disclosed because the Commission believes it has complied with paragraph (1), the Commission shall notify the manufacturer or private labeler that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 5 days after the date of the receipt of notification. The Commission may provide a lesser period of notice of intent to disclose if the Commission publishes a finding that the public health and safety requires a lesser period of notice.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to the date set for release of the document, the manufacturer or private labeler receiving the notice described in paragraph (2) may bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the documents are located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin disclosure of the document. The district court may enjoin such disclosure if the Commission has failed to take the reasonable steps prescribed in paragraph (1).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines that the public health and safety requires expedited consideration of an action brought under subparagraph (A), the Commission may file a request with the District Court for such expedited consideration. If the Commission files such a request, the District Court shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) assign the matter for hearing at the earliest possible date;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection shall not apply to the public disclosure of (A) information about any consumer product with respect to which product the Commission has filed an action under <uscode edition="2011" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode> (relating to imminently hazardous products), or which the Commission has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of any consumer product safety rule or provision of this Act or similar rule or provision of any other Act enforced by the Commission; or (B) information in the course of or concerning a rulemaking proceeding (which shall commence upon the publication of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking or a notice of proposed rulemaking), an adjudicatory proceeding (which shall commence upon the issuance of a complaint) or other administrative or judicial proceeding under this Act.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Where the Commission initiates the public disclosure of information that reflects on the safety of a consumer product or class of consumer products, whether or not such information would enable the public to ascertain readily the identity of a manufacturer or private labeler, the Commission shall establish procedures designed to ensure that such information is accurate and not misleading.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If the Commission finds that, in the administration of this Act, it has made public disclosure of inaccurate or misleading information which reflects adversely upon the safety of any consumer product or class of consumer products, or the practices of any manufacturer, private labeler, distributor, or retailer of consumer products, it shall, in a manner equivalent to that in which such disclosure was made, take reasonable steps to publish a retraction of such inaccurate or misleading information.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may promulgate consumer product safety standards in accordance with the provisions of <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>. A consumer product safety standard shall consist of one or more of any of the following types of requirements:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Requirements expressed in terms of performance requirements.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Requirements that a consumer product be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings or instructions, or requirements respecting the form of warnings or instructions.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any requirement of such a standard shall be reasonably necessary to prevent or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reliance of Commission upon voluntary standards</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall rely upon voluntary consumer product safety standards rather than promulgate a consumer product safety standard prescribing requirements described in subsection (a) of this section whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (1);</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contribution of Commission to development cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person participates with the Commission in the development of a consumer product safety standard, the Commission may agree to contribute to the person's cost with respect to such participation, in any case in which the Commission determines that such contribution is likely to result in a more satisfactory standard than would be developed without such contribution, and that the person is financially responsible. Regulations of the Commission shall set forth the items of cost in which it may participate, and shall exclude any contribution to the acquisition of land or buildings. Payments under agreements entered into under this subsection may be made without regard to section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the "Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act".</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Safety standards</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in accordance with <uscode edition="2011" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, promulgate consumer product safety standards that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_B_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timetable for rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2011" section="2060" title="15">section 2060(g) of this title</uscode>, as added by section 236 of this Act.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4_A"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice of adoption of voluntary standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission's action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4_B"></a>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Commission action on revised voluntary standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>, effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cribs</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be a violation of <uscode detail="(a)(1)" edition="2011" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a)(1) of this title</uscode> for any person to which this subsection applies to manufacture, sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, offer, provide for use, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce a crib that is not in compliance with a standard promulgated under subsection (b).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Persons to which subsection applies</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of any revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any revision of the standard promulgated under subsection (b)(1)(B) subsequent to the initial promulgation of a standard under such subsection, paragraph (1) shall apply only to a person that manufactures or imports cribs, unless the Commission determines that application to any other person described in paragraph (2) is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk to health or safety. If the Commission determines that application to a person described in paragraph (2) is necessary, it shall provide not less than 12 months for such person to come into compliance.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Crib defined</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_d_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and</p>

<a name="substructure-location_d_3"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Record keeping and notification requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall conduct a study at such time as it considers appropriate on the effectiveness of the consumer registration forms required by this section in facilitating product recalls and whether such registration forms should be required for other children's products.

<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, based on the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission determines by rule that a recall notification technology is likely to be as effective or more effective in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products as the registration forms required by subsection (d), the Commission—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a report on such determination; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall permit a manufacturer of durable infant or toddler products to use such technology in lieu of such registration forms to facilitate recalls of durable infant or toddler products.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, shall examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 or its successor standard (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4), as it relates to safety requirements, safety labeling requirements, and test methods related to—</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after the completion of the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall promulgate rules in accordance with <uscode edition="2011" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode> that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury of such toys.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review and revise the rules set forth under this section to ensure that such rules provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consideration of remaining ASTM standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After promulgating the rules required by subsection (b), the Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 (and alternative health protective requirements to prevent or minimize flammability of children's products) or its successor standard, and shall assess the adequacy of such standards in protecting children from safety hazards; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in accordance with <uscode edition="2011" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, promulgate consumer product safety rules that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account other children's product safety rules; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such toys.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prioritization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall promulgate rules beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment as consumer product safety standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Rules issued under this section shall be considered consumer product safety standards issued by the Commission under <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If ASTM International (or its successor entity) proposes to revise ASTM F963–07, or a successor standard, it shall notify the Commission of the proposed revision. The Commission shall incorporate the revision or a section of the revision into the consumer product safety rule. The revised standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission under <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>, effective 180 days after the date on which ASTM International notifies the Commission of the revision unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies ASTM International that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard. If the Commission so notifies ASTM International with respect to a proposed revision of the standard, the existing standard shall continue to be considered to be a consumer product safety rule without regard to the proposed revision.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rulemaking to consider exemption from preemption</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_h_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption of State law from preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, consider a rulemaking to exempt from the provisions of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2011" section="2075" title="15">section 2075(a) of this title</uscode> (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a children's product subject to the consumer product safety standards described in subsection (a) or any rule promulgated under this section. The Commission shall grant such an exemption if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard or rule under this section; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this Act for such consumer product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of standards on established State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section or in <uscode edition="2011" section="2075" title="15">section 2075 of this title</uscode> shall prevent a State or political subdivision of a State from continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a toy or other children's product that is designed to deal with the same risk of injury as the consumer product safety standards established by this section and that is in effect on the day before August 14, 2008, if such State or political subdivision has filed such requirement with the Commission within 90 days after August 14, 2008, in such form and in such manner as the Commission may require.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The issuance of any rule under this section is subject to judicial review as provided in <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2011" section="2060" title="15">section 2060(g) of this title</uscode>, as added by section 236 of this Act.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of proceeding; publication of prescribed notice of proposed rulemaking; transmittal of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding for the development of a consumer product safety rule may be commenced by the publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify the product and the nature of the risk of injury associated with the product;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include a summary of each of the regulatory alternatives under consideration by the Commission (including voluntary consumer product safety standards);</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include information with respect to any existing standard known to the Commission which may be relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such standard does not eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1);</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of publication of the notice), comments with respect to the risk of injury identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the risk;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), an existing standard or a portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary consumer product safety standard to address the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1) together with a description of a plan to modify or develop the standard.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voluntary standard; publication as proposed rule; notice of reliance of Commission on standard</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(5) of this section if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer product safety standard, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in a notice under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer product safety rule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(6) of this section is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication of proposed rule; preliminary regulatory analysis; contents; transmittal of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No consumer product safety rule may be proposed by the Commission unless the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (a)(5) of this section was not published by the Commission as the proposed rule or part of the proposed rule;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (a)(6) of this section and assisted by the Commission as required by <uscode detail="(a)(3)" edition="2011" section="2054" title="15">section 2054(a)(3) of this title</uscode> would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary consumer product safety standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed by the proposed rule; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed rule, together with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any proposed consumer product safety rule shall be issued within twelve months after the date of publication of the notice, unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury associated with the product or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend the twelve-month period for good cause. If the Commission extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of such extension to the appropriate Congressional committees. Such notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The Commission shall publish notice of such extension and the information submitted to the Congress in the Federal Register. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any person from submitting an existing standard or portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Promulgation of rule; time</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after the publication under subsection (c) of this section of a proposed consumer product safety rule respecting a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, the Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting the risk of injury associated with such product, if it makes the findings required under subsection (f) of this section, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking if it determines that such rule is not (i) reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product, or (ii) in the public interest;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may extend such 60-day period for good cause shown (if it publishes its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Consumer product safety rules shall be promulgated in accordance with <uscode edition="2011" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expression of risk of injury; consideration of available product data; needs of elderly and handicapped</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer product safety rule shall express in the rule itself the risk of injury which the standard is designed to eliminate or reduce. In promulgating such a rule the Commission shall consider relevant available product data including the results of research, development, testing, and investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant to this chapter. In the promulgation of such a rule the Commission shall also consider and take into account the special needs of elderly and handicapped persons to determine the extent to which such persons may be adversely affected by such rule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; final regulatory analysis; judicial review of rule</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Prior to promulgating a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect to—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the degree and nature of the risk of injury the rule is designed to eliminate or reduce;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the approximate number of consumer products, or types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need of the public for the consumer products subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule upon the utility, cost, or availability of such products to meet such need; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any preliminary or final regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (f)(2) of this section shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a rule is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_4_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date of rule or standard; stockpiling of product</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_g_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each consumer product safety rule shall specify the date such rule is to take effect not exceeding 180 days from the date promulgated, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of a consumer product safety standard under this chapter shall be set at a date at least 30 days after the date of promulgation unless the Commission for good cause shown determines that an earlier effective date is in the public interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date which is earlier than the date of promulgation. A consumer product safety standard shall be applicable only to consumer products manufactured after the effective date.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may by rule prohibit a manufacturer of a consumer product from stockpiling any product to which a consumer product safety rule applies, or to which a rule under this chapter or similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission applies, so as to prevent such manufacturer from circumventing the purpose of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "stockpiling" means manufacturing or importing a product between the date of promulgation of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban and its effective date at a rate which is significantly greater (as determined under the rule under this paragraph) than the rate at which such product was produced or imported during a base period (prescribed in the rule under this paragraph) ending before the date of promulgation of the rule, regulation, standard, or ban.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amendment or revocation of rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may by rule amend or revoke any consumer product safety rule. Such amendment or revocation shall specify the date on which it is to take effect which shall not exceed 180 days from the date the amendment or revocation is published unless the Commission finds for good cause shown that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an amendment involves a material change in a consumer product safety rule, <uscode edition="2011" range="2056 and 2057" section="2056" title="15">sections 2056 and 2057 of this title</uscode>, and subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall apply. In order to revoke a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal Register, and allow oral and written presentations in accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section. It may revoke such rule only if it determines that the rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product. <uscode edition="2011" section="2060" title="15">Section 2060 of this title</uscode> shall apply to any amendment of a consumer product safety rule which involves a material change and to any revocation of a consumer product safety rule, in the same manner and to the same extent as such section applies to the Commission's action in promulgating such a rule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Petition to initiate rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2011" section="553" title="5">section 553(e) of title 5</uscode> requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition by persons adversely affected, consumers, or consumer organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 60 days after a consumer product safety rule is promulgated by the Commission, any person adversely affected by such rule, or any consumer or consumer organization, may file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia, or for the circuit in which such person, consumer, or organization resides or has his principal place of business for judicial review of such rule. Copies of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other officer designated by it for that purpose and to the Attorney General. The record of the proceedings on which the Commission based its rule shall be filed in the court as provided for in <uscode edition="2011" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. For purposes of this section, the term "record" means such consumer product safety rule; any notice or proposal published pursuant to <uscode edition="2011" range="2056, 2057, or 2058" section="2056" title="15">section 2056, 2057, or 2058 of this title</uscode>; the transcript required by <uscode detail="(d)(2)" edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(d)(2) of this title</uscode> of any oral presentation; any written submission of interested parties; and any other information which the Commission considers relevant to such rule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional data, views, or arguments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional data, views, or arguments and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional data, views, or arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds for the petitioner's failure to adduce such data, views, or arguments in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order the Commission to provide additional opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments and for written submissions. The Commission may modify its findings, or make new findings by reason of the additional data, views, or arguments so taken and shall file such modified or new findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original rule, with the return of such additional data, views, or arguments.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction; costs and attorneys&amp;apos; fees; substantial evidence to support administrative findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of the petition under subsection (a) of this section the court shall have jurisdiction to review the consumer product safety rule in accordance with <uscode chapter="7" edition="2011" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>, and to grant appropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided in such chapter. A court may in the interest of justice include in such relief an award of the costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees (determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section <sup><a href="#2060_1_target" name="2060_1">1</a></sup> and reasonable expert witnesses&amp;apos; fees. Attorneys&amp;apos; fees may be awarded against the United States (or any agency or official of the United States) without regard to <uscode edition="2011" section="2412" title="28">section 2412 of title 28</uscode> or any other provision of law. The consumer product safety rule shall not be affirmed unless the Commission's findings under <uscode detail="(f)(1)" edition="2011" range="2058(f)(1) and 2058(f)(3)" section="2058" title="15">sections 2058(f)(1) and 2058(f)(3) of this title</uscode> are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supreme Court review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any consumer product safety rule shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided in <uscode edition="2011" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may file in a United States district court an action (1) against an imminently hazardous consumer product for seizure of such product under subsection (b)(2) of this section, or (2) against any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product, or (3) against both. Such an action may be filed notwithstanding the existence of a consumer product safety rule applicable to such product, or the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings under any other provision of this chapter. As used in this section, and hereinafter in this chapter, the term "imminently hazardous consumer product" means a consumer product which presents imminent and unreasonable risk of death, serious illness, or severe personal injury.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relief; product condemnation and seizure</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The district court in which such action is filed shall have jurisdiction to declare such product an imminently hazardous consumer product, and (in the case of an action under subsection (a)(2) of this section) to grant (as ancillary to such declaration or in lieu thereof) such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect the public from such risk. Such relief may include a mandatory order requiring the notification of such risk to purchasers of such product known to the defendant, public notice, the recall, the repair or the replacement of, or refund for, such product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the consumer product may be proceeded against by process of libel for the seizure and condemnation of such product in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which such consumer product is found. Proceedings and cases instituted under the authority of the preceding sentence shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consumer product safety rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of such action or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule applicable to the consumer product with respect to which such action is filed.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction and venue; process; subpena</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An action under subsection (a)(2) of this section may be brought in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, is an inhabitant or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. Subpenas requiring attendance of witnesses in such an action may run into any other district. In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under this section in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Commission shall take into account the convenience of the parties.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever proceedings under this section involving substantially similar consumer products are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all other parties in interest.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Employment of attorneys by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under this section, the Commission may direct attorneys employed by it to appear and represent it.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) <sup><a href="#2061_1_target" name="2061_1">1</a></sup> Cost-benefit analysis of compliance with relief ordered in action for judicial review of consumer product safety rule not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining whether to bring an action against a consumer product or a person under this section, to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in complying with the relief that may be ordered in such action with the benefits to the public from such relief.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term "substantial product hazard" means—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a failure to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule under this chapter or a similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission which creates a substantial risk of injury to the public, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a product defect which (because of the pattern of defect, the number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severity of the risk, or otherwise) creates a substantial risk of injury to the public.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Noncompliance with applicable consumer product safety rules; product defects; notice to Commission by manufacturer, distributor, or retailer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of a consumer product, or other product or substance over which the Commission has jurisdiction under any other Act enforced by the Commission (other than motor vehicle equipment as defined in <uscode detail="(a)(7)" edition="2011" section="30102" title="49">section 30102(a)(7) of title 49</uscode>), distributed in commerce, and every distributor and retailer of such product, who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that such product—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) fails to comply with any other rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter or any other Act enforced by the Commission;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard described in subsection (a)(2) of this section; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall immediately inform the Commission of such failure to comply, of such defect, or of such risk, unless such manufacturer, distributor, or retailer has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of such defect, failure to comply, or such risk. A report provided under paragraph (2) may not be used as the basis for criminal prosecution of the reporting person under <uscode edition="2011" section="1264" title="15">section 1264 of this title</uscode>, except for offenses which require a showing of intent to defraud or mislead.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of defect or failure to comply; mail notice</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification is required in order to adequately protect the public from such substantial product hazard, or if the Commission, after notifying the manufacturer, determines a product to be an imminently hazardous consumer product and has filed an action under <uscode edition="2011" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode>, the Commission may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of the product to take any one or more of the following actions:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To cease distribution of the product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) To notify all persons that transport, store, distribute, or otherwise handle the product, or to which the product has been transported, sold, distributed, or otherwise handled, to cease immediately distribution of the product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To notify appropriate State and local public health officials.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) To give public notice of the defect or failure to comply, including posting clear and conspicuous notice on its Internet website, providing notice to any third party Internet website on which such manufacturer, retailer, distributor, or licensor has placed the product for sale, and announcements in languages other than English and on radio and television where the Commission determines that a substantial number of consumers to whom the recall is directed may not be reached by other notice.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) To mail notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) To mail notice to every person to whom the person required to give notice knows such product was delivered or sold.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any such order shall specify the form and content of any notice required to be given under such order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require a notice described in paragraph (1) to be distributed in a language other than English if the Commission determines that doing so is necessary to adequately protect the public.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a district court determines, in an action filed under <uscode edition="2011" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode>, that the product that is the subject of such action is not an imminently hazardous consumer product, the Commission shall rescind any order issued under this subsection with respect to such product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repair; replacement; refunds; action plan</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested parties, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that action under this subsection is in the public interest, it may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of such product to provide the notice required by subsection (c) and to take any one or more of the following actions it determines to be in the public interest:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To bring such product into conformity with the requirements of the applicable rule, regulation, standard, or ban or to repair the defect in such product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) To replace such product with a like or equivalent product which complies with the applicable rule, regulation, standard, or ban or which does not contain the defect.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To refund the purchase price of such product (less a reasonable allowance for use, if such product has been in the possession of a consumer for one year or more (i) at the time of public notice under subsection (c) of this section, or (ii) at the time the consumer receives actual notice of the defect or noncompliance, whichever first occurs).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order under this subsection shall also require the person to whom it applies to submit a plan, for approval by the Commission, for taking action under whichever of the preceding subparagraphs under which such person has been ordered to act. The Commission shall specify in the order the persons to whom refunds must be made if the Commission orders the action described in subparagraph (C)..<sup><a href="#2064_1_target" name="2064_1">1</a></sup> An order under this subsection may prohibit the person to whom it applies from manufacturing for sale, offering for sale, distributing in commerce, or importing into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or from doing any combination of such actions, the product with respect to which the order was issued.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Commission approves an action plan, it shall indicate its approval in writing.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission finds that an approved action plan is not effective or appropriate under the circumstances, or that the manufacturer, retailer, or distributor is not executing an approved action plan effectively, the Commission may, by order, amend, or require amendment of, the action plan. In determining whether an approved plan is effective or appropriate under the circumstances, the Commission shall consider whether a repair or replacement changes the intended functionality of the product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for comment, that a manufacturer, retailer, or distributor has failed to comply substantially with its obligations under its action plan, the Commission may revoke its approval of the action plan. The manufacturer, retailer, or distributor to which the action plan applies may not distribute in commerce the product to which the action plan relates after receipt of notice of a revocation of the action plan.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under an order issued under subsection (d) of this section, and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under subsection (c) or (d) of this section with respect to a product may require any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the product to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out the order, if the Commission determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Hearing</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an order under subsection (c) or (d) of this section may be issued only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with <uscode edition="2011" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode> except that, if the Commission determines that any person who wishes to participate in such hearing is a part of a class of participants who share an identity of interest, the Commission may limit such person's participation in such hearing to participation through a single representative designated by such class (or by the Commission if such class fails to designate such a representative). Any settlement offer which is submitted to the presiding officer at a hearing under this subsection shall be transmitted by the officer to the Commission for its consideration unless the settlement offer is clearly frivolous or duplicative of offers previously made.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirement for a hearing in paragraph (1) shall not apply to an order issued under subsection (c) or (d) relating to an imminently hazardous consumer product with regard to which the Commission has filed an action under <uscode edition="2011" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preliminary injunction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any consumer product offered for importation into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) shall be refused admission into such customs territory if such product—</p>

<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Product destruction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Products refused admission into the customs territory of the United States shall be destroyed unless, upon application by the owner, consignee, or importer of record, the Secretary of the Treasury permits the export of the product in lieu of destruction.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of expenses occasioned by refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in connection with the destruction provided for in this section (the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury) and all expenses in connection with the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any consumer product refused admission under this section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Inspection and recordkeeping requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Manufacturers of imported products shall be in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under <uscode edition="2011" section="2065" title="15">section 2065 of this title</uscode> applicable to such products, and the Commission shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury of any manufacturer who is not in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under <uscode edition="2011" section="2065" title="15">section 2065 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_h_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may provide to the agencies with which it is cooperating under paragraph (1) such information, data, violator lists, test results, and other support, guidance, and documents as may be necessary or helpful for such agencies to cooperate with the Commission to carry out the product surveillance program under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This chapter shall not apply to any consumer product if (1) it can be shown that such product is manufactured, sold, or held for sale for export from the United States (or that such product was imported for export), unless (A) such consumer product is in fact distributed in commerce for use in the United States, or (B) the Commission determines that exportation of such product presents an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers within the United States, and (2) such consumer product when distributed in commerce, or any container in which it is enclosed when so distributed, bears a stamp or label stating that such consumer product is intended for export; except that this chapter shall apply to any consumer product manufactured for sale, offered for sale, or sold for shipment to any installation of the United States located outside of the United States.</p>

A violation of <uscode detail="(a)(3)" edition="2011" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a)(3) of this title</uscode> shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each failure or refusal to allow or perform an act required thereby; and, if such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State compliance to Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a consumer product safety standard under this chapter is in effect and applies to a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, no State or political subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to establish or to continue in effect any provision of a safety standard or regulation which prescribes any requirements as to the performance, composition, contents, design, finish, construction, packaging, or labeling of such product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury associated with such consumer product, unless such requirements are identical to the requirements of the Federal standard.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consumer product safety requirements which impose performance standards more stringent than Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section does not prevent the Federal Government or the government of any State or political subdivision of a State from establishing or continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a consumer product for its own use which requirement is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with the product and which is not identical to the consumer product safety standard applicable to the product under this chapter if the Federal, State, or political subdivision requirement provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the standard applicable under this chapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission may by rule, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) of this section (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety standard under this chapter if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard under this chapter, and</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this chapter for such consumer product.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2082. Interim cellulose insulation safety standard</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), on and after the last day of the 60-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C (as such specification was in effect on February 1, 1978), shall be deemed to be an interim consumer product safety standard which shall have all the authority and effect of any other consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under this chapter. During the 45-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the Commission may make, and shall publish in the Federal Register, such technical, nonsubstantive changes in such requirements as it deems appropriate to make such requirements suitable for promulgation as a consumer product safety standard. At the end to the 60-day period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register such interim consumer product safety standard, as altered by the Commission under this paragraph.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interim consumer product safety standard established in paragraph (1) shall provide that any cellulose insulation which is produced or distributed for sale or use as a consumer product shall have a flame spread rating of 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During the period for which the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) of this section is in effect, in addition to complying with any labeling requirement established by the Commission under this chapter, each manufacturer or private labeler of cellulose insulation shall include the following statement on any container of such cellulose insulation: "ATTENTION: This material meets the applicable minimum Federal flammability standard. This standard is based upon laboratory tests only, which do not represent actual conditions which may occur in the home." Such statement shall be located in a conspicuous place on such container and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, and color with other printed matter on such container.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Judicial review of the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) of this section, as such standard is in effect on and after the last day of the 60-day period specified in such subsection, shall be limited solely to the issue of whether any changes made by the Commission under paragraph (1) are technical, nonsubstantive changes. For purposes of such review, any change made by the Commission under paragraph (1) which requires that any test to determine the flame spread rating of cellulose insulation shall include a correction for variations in test results caused by equipment used in the test shall be considered a technical, nonsubstantive change.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement; violations; promulgation of final standard; procedures applicable to promulgation; revision of interim standard; procedures applicable to revision</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any interim consumer product safety standard established pursuant to this section shall be enforced in the same manner as any other consumer product safety standard until such time as there is in effect a final consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission, as provided in subparagraph (B), or until such time as it is revoked by the Commission under <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(e) of this title</uscode>. A violation of the interim consumer product safety standard shall be deemed to be a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under <uscode edition="2011" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) may, not later than 180 days after the date on which such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discharge or discrimination and identifying the person responsible for such act. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the complainant and the person named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the Secretary a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the Secretary to present statements from witnesses, the Secretary shall initiate an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's findings. If the Secretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall accompany the Secretary's findings with a preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 days after the date of notification of findings under this paragraph, either the person alleged to have committed the violation or the complainant may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. Any such hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection and shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) unless the complainant makes a prima facie showing that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the complainant has made the showing required under clause (i), no investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B_iv"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall issue a final order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the Secretary, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall order the person who committed such violation—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to provide compensatory damages to the complainant.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">If such an order is issued under this paragraph, the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&amp;apos; and expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which the order was issued.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary may award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fee, not exceeding $1,000, to be paid by the complainant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint, or within 90 days after receiving a written determination, the complainant may bring an action at law or equity for <i>de novo</i> review in the appropriate district court of the United States with jurisdiction, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried by the court with a jury. The proceedings shall be governed by the same legal burdens of proof specified in paragraph (2)(B). The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all relief necessary to make the employee whole, including injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had, but for the discharge or discrimination;</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_4_C"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Unless the complainant brings an action under paragraph (4), any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order issued under paragraph (3) may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation. The petition for review must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary. Review shall conform to <uscode chapter="7" edition="2011" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review could have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Whenever any person has failed to comply with an order issued under paragraph (3), the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur, or in the United States district court for the District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and compensatory damages.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) A person on whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (3) may commence a civil action against the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under <uscode edition="2011" section="1361" title="28">section 1361 of title 28</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
