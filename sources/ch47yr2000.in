<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an unacceptable number of consumer products which present unreasonable risks of injury are distributed in commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public should be protected against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) control by State and local governments of unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products is inadequate and may be burdensome to manufacturers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) existing Federal authority to protect consumers from exposure to consumer products presenting unreasonable risks of injury is inadequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) regulation of consumer products the distribution or use of which affects interstate or foreign commerce is necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this chapter are—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.</p>

<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commission or its representative under this Act which information contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to in <uscode edition="2000" section="1905" title="18">section 1905 of title 18</uscode> or subject to <uscode detail="(b)(4)" edition="2000" section="552" title="5">section 552(b)(4) of title 5</uscode> shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall, prior to the disclosure of any information which will permit the public to ascertain readily the identity of a manufacturer or private labeler of a consumer product, offer such manufacturer or private labeler an opportunity to mark such information as confidential and therefore barred from disclosure under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All information that a manufacturer or private labeler has marked to be confidential and barred from disclosure under paragraph (2), either at the time of submission or pursuant to paragraph (3), shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the procedures established in paragraphs (5) and (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Commission determines that a document marked as confidential by a manufacturer or private labeler to be barred from disclosure under paragraph (2) may be disclosed because it is not confidential information as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall notify such person in writing that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 10 days after the date of receipt of notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any person receiving such notification may, if he believes such disclosure is barred by paragraph (2), before the date set for release of the document, bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place or business, or in which the documents are located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to restrain disclosure of the document. Any person receiving such notification may file with the appropriate district court or court of appeals of the United States, as appropriate, an application for a stay of disclosure.

The Commission shall take reasonable steps to assure, prior to its public disclosure thereof, that information from which the identity of such manufacturer or private labeler may be readily ascertained is accurate, and that such disclosure is fair in the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of this Act. In disclosing any information under this subsection, the Commission may, and upon the request of the manufacturer or private labeler shall, include with the disclosure any comments or other information or a summary thereof submitted by such manufacturer or private labeler to the extent permitted by and subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that a document claimed to be inaccurate by a manufacturer or private labeler under paragraph (1) should be disclosed because the Commission believes it has complied with paragraph (1), the Commission shall notify the manufacturer or private labeler that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 10 days after the date of the receipt of notification. The Commission may provide a lesser period of notice of intent to disclose if the Commission finds that the public health and safety requires a lesser period of notice and publishes such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Prior to the date set for release of the document, the manufacturer or private labeler receiving the notice described in paragraph (2) may bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the documents are located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin disclosure of the document.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may promulgate consumer product safety standards in accordance with the provisions of <uscode edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>. A consumer product safety standard shall consist of one or more of any of the following types of requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Requirements expressed in terms of performance requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Requirements that a consumer product be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings or instructions, or requirements respecting the form of warnings or instructions.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any requirement of such a standard shall be reasonably necessary to prevent or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reliance of Commission upon voluntary standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall rely upon voluntary consumer product safety standards rather than promulgate a consumer product safety standard prescribing requirements described in subsection (a) of this section whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contribution of Commission to development cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person participates with the Commission in the development of a consumer product safety standard, the Commission may agree to contribute to the person's cost with respect to such participation, in any case in which the Commission determines that such contribution is likely to result in a more satisfactory standard than would be developed without such contribution, and that the person is financially responsible. Regulations of the Commission shall set forth the items of cost in which it may participate, and shall exclude any contribution to the acquisition of land or buildings. Payments <!-- PDFPage:1235 -->under agreements entered into under this subsection may be made without regard to section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of proceeding; publication of prescribed notice of proposed rulemaking; transmittal of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding for the development of a consumer product safety rule shall be commenced by the publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify the product and the nature of the risk of injury associated with the product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include a summary of each of the regulatory alternatives under consideration by the Commission (including voluntary consumer product safety standards);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include information with respect to any existing standard known to the Commission which may be relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such standard does not eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of publication of the notice), comments with respect to the risk of injury identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the risk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), an existing standard or a portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary consumer product safety standard to address the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1) together with a description of a plan to modify or develop the standard.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voluntary standard; publication as proposed rule; notice of reliance of Commission on standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(5) of this section if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer product safety standard, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in the notice under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer product safety rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(6) of this section is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1238 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication of proposed rule; preliminary regulatory analysis; contents; transmittal of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No consumer product safety rule may be proposed by the Commission unless, not less than 60 days after publication of the notice required in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (a)(5) of this section was not published by the Commission as the proposed rule or part of the proposed rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (a)(6) of this section and assisted by the Commission as required by <uscode detail="(a)(3)" edition="2000" section="2054" title="15">section 2054(a)(3) of this title</uscode> would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary consumer product safety standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed by the proposed rule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed rule, together with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. Any proposed consumer product safety rule shall be issued within twelve months after the date of publication of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under subsection (a) of this section relating to the product involved, unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury associated with the product or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend the twelve-month period for good cause. If the Commission extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of such extension to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. Such notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The Commission shall publish notice of such extension and the information submitted to the Congress in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Promulgation of rule; time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after the publication under subsection (c) of this section of a proposed consumer product safety rule respecting a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting the risk of injury associated with such product, if it makes the findings required under subsection (f) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking if it determines that such rule is not (i) reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product, or (ii) in the public interest;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may extend such 60-day period for good cause shown (if it publishes its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Consumer product safety rules shall be promulgated in accordance with <uscode edition="2000" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expression of risk of injury; consideration of available product data; needs of elderly and handicapped</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer product safety rule shall express in the rule itself the risk of injury which the standard is designed to eliminate or reduce. In promulgating such a rule the Commission shall consider relevant available product data including the results of research, development, testing, and investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant to this chapter. In the promulgation of such a rule the Commission shall also consider and take into account the special needs of elderly and handicapped persons to determine the extent to which such persons may be adversely affected by such rule.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1239 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; final regulatory analysis; judicial review of rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Prior to promulgating a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the degree and nature of the risk of injury the rule is designed to eliminate or reduce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the approximate number of consumer products, or types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need of the public for the consumer products subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule upon the utility, cost, or availability of such products to meet such need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it has prepared, on the basis of the findings of the Commission under paragraph (1) and on other information before the Commission, a final regulatory analysis of the rule containing the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the rule, including costs and benefits that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A description of any alternatives to the final rule which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it finds (and includes such finding in the rule)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the rule (including its effective date) is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the promulgation of the rule is in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a rule declaring the product a banned hazardous product, that no feasible consumer product safety standard under this chapter would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a rule which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such rule have adopted and implemented a voluntary consumer product safety standard, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any preliminary or final regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (f)(2) of this section shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a rule is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date of rule or standard; stockpiling of product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each consumer product safety rule shall specify the date such rule is to take effect not exceeding 180 days from the date promulgated, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of a consumer product safety standard under this chapter shall be set at a date at least 30 days after the date of promulgation unless the Commission for good cause shown determines that an earlier effective date is in the public interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date which is earlier than the date of promulgation. A consumer product safety standard shall be applicable only to consumer products manufactured after the effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may by rule prohibit a manufacturer of a consumer product from stockpiling any product to which a consumer product safety rule applies, so as to prevent such manufacturer from circumventing the purpose of such consumer product safety rule. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “stockpiling” means manufacturing or importing a product between the date of promulgation of such consumer product safety rule and its effective date at a rate which is significantly greater (as determined under the rule under this paragraph) than the rate at which such product was produced or imported during a base period (prescribed in the rule under this paragraph) ending before the date of promulgation of the consumer product safety rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amendment or revocation of rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may by rule amend or revoke any consumer product safety rule. Such amendment or revocation shall specify the date on which it is to take effect which shall not exceed 180 days from the date the amendment or revocation is published unless the Commission finds for good cause shown that a later effective <!-- PDFPage:1240 -->date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an amendment involves a material change in a consumer product safety rule, <uscode edition="2000" range="2056 and 2057" section="2056" title="15">sections 2056 and 2057 of this title</uscode>, and subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall apply. In order to revoke a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal Register, and allow oral and written presentations in accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section. It may revoke such rule only if it determines that the rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product. <uscode edition="2000" section="2060" title="15">Section 2060 of this title</uscode> shall apply to any amendment of a consumer product safety rule which involves a material change and to any revocation of a consumer product safety rule, in the same manner and to the same extent as such section applies to the Commission's action in promulgating such a rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Petition to initiate rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2000" section="553" title="5">section 553(e) of title 5</uscode> requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2060. Judicial review of consumer product safety rules</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition by persons adversely affected, consumers, or consumer organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 60 days after a consumer product safety rule is promulgated by the Commission, any person adversely affected by such rule, or any consumer or consumer organization, may file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia, or for the circuit in which such person, consumer, or organization resides or has his principal place of business for judicial review of such rule. Copies of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other officer designated by it for that purpose and to the Attorney General. The record of the proceedings on which the Commission based its rule shall be filed in the court as provided for in <uscode edition="2000" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. For purposes of this section, the term “record” means such consumer product safety rule; any notice or proposal published pursuant to <uscode edition="2000" range="2056, 2057, or 2058" section="2056" title="15">section 2056, 2057, or 2058 of this title</uscode>; the transcript required by <uscode detail="(d)(2)" edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(d)(2) of this title</uscode> of any oral presentation; any written submission of interested parties; and any other information which the Commission considers relevant to such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional data, views, or arguments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional data, views, or arguments and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional data, views, or arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds for the petitioner's failure to adduce such data, views, or arguments in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order the Commission to provide additional opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments and for written submissions. The Commission may modify its findings, or make new findings by reason of the additional data, views, or arguments so taken and shall file such modified or new findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original rule, with the return of such additional data, views, or arguments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction; costs and attorneys’ fees; substantial evidence to support administrative findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of the petition under subsection (a) of this section the court shall have jurisdiction to review the consumer product safety rule in accordance with <uscode chapter="7" edition="2000" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>, and to grant appropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided in such chapter. A court may in the interest of justice include in such relief an award of the costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section <sup><a href="#2060_1_target" name="2060_1">1</a></sup> and reasonable expert witnesses’ fees. Attorneys’ fees may be awarded against the United States (or any agency or official of the United States) without regard to <uscode edition="2000" section="2412" title="28">section 2412 of title 28</uscode> or any other provision of law. The consumer product safety rule shall not be affirmed unless the Commission's findings under <uscode detail="(f)(1)" edition="2000" range="2058(f)(1) and 2058(f)(3)" section="2058" title="15">sections 2058(f)(1) and 2058(f)(3) of this title</uscode> are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supreme Court review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any consumer product safety rule shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided in <uscode edition="2000" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Other remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The remedies provided for in this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies provided by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Computation of reasonable fee for attorney</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2000" range="2072(a) and 2073" section="2072" title="15">sections 2072(a) and 2073 of this title</uscode>, a reasonable attorney's fee is a fee (1) which is based upon (A) the actual time expended by an attorney in providing advice and other legal services in connection with representing a person in an action brought under this section, and (B) such reasonable expenses as may be incurred by the attorney in the provision of such services, and (2) which is computed at the rate prevailing for the provision of similar services with respect to actions brought in the court which is awarding such fee.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may file in a United States district court an action (1) against an imminently hazardous consumer product for seizure of such product under subsection (b)(2) of this section, or (2) against any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product, or (3) against both. Such an action may be filed notwithstanding the existence of a consumer product safety rule applicable to such product, or the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings under any other provision of this chapter. As used in this section, and hereinafter in this chapter, the term “imminently hazardous consumer product” means a consumer product which presents imminent and unreasonable risk of death, serious illness, or severe personal injury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relief; product condemnation and seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The district court in which such action is filed shall have jurisdiction to declare such product an imminently hazardous consumer product, and (in the case of an action under subsection (a)(2) of this section) to grant (as ancillary to such declaration or in lieu thereof) such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect the public from such risk. Such relief may include a mandatory order requiring the notification of such risk to purchasers of such product known to the defendant, public notice, the recall, the repair or the replacement of, or refund for, such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the consumer product may be proceeded against by process of libel for the seizure and condemnation of such product in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which such consumer product is found. Proceedings and cases instituted under the authority of the preceding sentence shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consumer product safety rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of such action or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule applicable to the consumer product with respect to which such action is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction and venue; process; subpena</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An action under subsection (a)(2) of this section may be brought in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, is an inhabitant or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. Subpenas requiring attendance of witnesses in such an action may run into any other district. In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under this section in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Commission shall take into account the convenience of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever proceedings under this section involving substantially similar consumer products are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all other parties in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Employment of attorneys by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under this section, the Commission may direct attorneys employed by it to appear and represent it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) <sup><a href="#2061_1_target" name="2061_1">1</a></sup> Cost-benefit analysis of compliance with relief ordered in action for judicial review of consumer product safety rule not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining whether to bring an action against a consumer product or a person under this section, to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in complying with the relief that may be ordered in such action with the benefits to the public from such relief.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2063. Product certification and labeling</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Certification accompanying product; products with more than one manufacturer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every manufacturer of a product which is subject to a consumer product safety standard under this chapter and which is distributed in commerce (and the private labeler of such product if it bears a private label) shall issue a certificate which shall certify that such product conforms to all applicable consumer product safety standards, and shall specify any standard which is applicable. Such certificate shall accompany the product or shall otherwise be furnished to any distributor or retailer to whom the product is delivered. Any certificate under this subsection shall be based on a test of each product or upon a reasonable testing program; shall state the name of the manufacturer or private labeler issuing the certificate; and shall include the date and place of manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a consumer product for which there is more than one manufacturer or more than one private labeler, the Commission may by rule designate one or more of such manufacturers or one or more of such private labelers (as the case may be) as the persons who shall issue the certificate required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, and may exempt all other manufacturers of such product or all other private labelers of the product (as the case may be) from the requirement under paragraph (1) to issue a certificate with respect to such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules to establish reasonable testing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may by rule prescribe reasonable testing programs for consumer products which are subject to consumer product safety standards under this chapter and for which a certificate is required under subsection (a) of this section. Any test or testing program on the basis of which a certificate is issued under subsection (a) of this section may, at the option of the person required to certify the product, be conducted by an independent third party qualified to perform such tests or testing programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Form and contents of labels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may by rule require the use and prescribe the form and content of labels which contain the following information (or that portion of it specified in the rule)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The date and place of manufacture of any consumer product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A suitable identification of the manufacturer of the consumer product, unless the product bears a private label in which case it shall identify the private labeler and shall also contain a code mark which will permit the seller of such product to identify the manufacturer thereof to the purchaser upon his request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the case of a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety rule, a certification that the product meets all applicable consumer product safety standards and a specification of the standards which are applicable.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such labels, where practicable, may be required by the Commission to be permanently marked on or affixed to any such consumer product. The Commission may, in appropriate cases, permit information required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection to be coded.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2064. Substantial product hazards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) “Substantial product hazard” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term “substantial product hazard” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a failure to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule which creates a substantial risk of injury to the public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a product defect which (because of the pattern of defect, the number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severity of the risk, or otherwise) creates a substantial risk of injury to the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Noncompliance with applicable consumer product safety rules; product defects; notice to Commission by manufacturer, distributor, or retailer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of a consumer product distributed in commerce, and every distributor and retailer of such product, who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that such product—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under <uscode edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard described in subsection (a)(2) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall immediately inform the Commission of such failure to comply, of such defect, or of such risk, unless such manufacturer, distributor, or retailer has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of such defect, failure to comply, or such risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Public notice of defect or failure to comply; mail notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines (after affording interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification is required in order to adequately protect the public from such substantial product hazard, the Commission may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of the product to take any one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To give public notice of the defect or failure to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To mail notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To mail notice to every person to whom the person required to give notice knows such product was delivered or sold.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<!-- PDFPage:1244 --><p class="statutory-body-block">Any such order shall specify the form and content of any notice required to be given under such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repair; replacement; refunds; action plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines (after affording interested parties, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that action under this subsection is in the public interest, it may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of such product to take whichever of the following actions the person to whom the order is directed elects:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To bring such product into conformity with the requirements of the applicable consumer product safety rule or to repair the defect in such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To replace such product with a like or equivalent product which complies with the applicable consumer product safety rule or which does not contain the defect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To refund the purchase price of such product (less a reasonable allowance for use, if such product has been in the possession of a consumer for one year or more (A) at the time of public notice under subsection (c) of this section, or (B) at the time the consumer receives actual notice of the defect or noncompliance, whichever first occurs).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">An order under this subsection may also require the person to whom it applies to submit a plan, satisfactory to the Commission, for taking action under whichever of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection under which such person has elected to act. The Commission shall specify in the order the persons to whom refunds must be made if the person to whom the order is directed elects to take action described in paragraph (3). If an order under this subsection is directed to more than one person, the Commission shall specify which person has the election under this subsection. An order under this subsection may prohibit the person to whom it applies from manufacturing for sale, offering for sale, distributing in commerce, or importing into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or from doing any combination of such actions, the product with respect to which the order was issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under an order issued under subsection (d) of this section, and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under subsection (c) or (d) of this section with respect to a product may require any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the product to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out the order, if the Commission determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order under subsection (c) or (d) of this section may be issued only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with <uscode edition="2000" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode> except that, if the Commission determines that any person who wishes to participate in such hearing is a part of a class of participants who share an identity of interest, the Commission may limit such person's participation in such hearing to participation through a single representative designated by such class (or by the Commission if such class fails to designate such a representative). Any settlement offer which is submitted to the presiding officer at a hearing under this subsection shall be transmitted by the officer to the Commission for its consideration unless the settlement offer is clearly frivolous or duplicative of offers previously made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preliminary injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission has initiated a proceeding under this section for the issuance of an order under subsection (d) of this section with respect to a product which the Commission has reason to believe presents a substantial product hazard, the Commission (without regard to <uscode detail="(b)(7)" edition="2000" section="2076" title="15">section 2076(b)(7) of this title</uscode>) or the Attorney General may, in accordance with <uscode detail="(d)(1)" edition="2000" section="2061" title="15">section 2061(d)(1) of this title</uscode>, apply to a district court of the United States for the issuance of a preliminary injunction to restrain the distribution in commerce of such product pending the completion of such proceeding. If such a preliminary injunction has been issued, the Commission (or the Attorney General if the preliminary injunction was issued upon an application of the Attorney General) may apply to the issuing court for extensions of such preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any preliminary injunction, and any extension of a preliminary injunction, issued under this subsection with respect to a product shall be in effect for such period as the issuing court prescribes not to exceed a period which extends beyond the thirtieth day from the date of the issuance of the preliminary injunction (or, in the case of a preliminary injunction which has been extended, the date of its extension) or the date of the completion or termination of the proceeding under this section respecting such product, whichever date occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount in controversy requirement of <uscode edition="2000" section="1331" title="28">section 1331 of title 28</uscode> does not apply with respect to the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States to issue or exend <sup><a href="#2064_1_target" name="2064_1">1</a></sup> a preliminary injunction under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cost-benefit analysis of notification or other action not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification or other action under this section should be taken, <!-- PDFPage:1245 -->to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in providing notification or taking other action under this section with the benefits from such notification or action.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any consumer product offered for importation into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) shall be refused admission into such customs territory if such product—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not accompanied by a certificate required by <uscode edition="2000" section="2063" title="15">section 2063 of this title</uscode>, or is not labeled in accordance with regulations under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2000" section="2063" title="15">section 2063(c) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is or has been determined to be an imminently hazardous consumer product in a proceeding brought under <uscode edition="2000" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) has a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard (within the meaning of section 2064(a)(2)) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is a product which was manufactured by a person who the Commission has informed the Secretary of the Treasury is in violation of subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Samples</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall obtain without charge and deliver to the Commission, upon the latter's request, a reasonable number of samples of consumer products being offered for import. Except for those owners or consignees who are or have been afforded an opportunity for a hearing in a proceeding under <uscode edition="2000" section="2061" title="15">section 2061 of this title</uscode> with respect to an imminently hazardous product, the owner or consignee of the product shall be afforded an opportunity by the Commission for a hearing in accordance with <uscode edition="2000" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode> with respect to the importation of such products into the customs territory of the United States. If it appears from examination of such samples or otherwise that a product must be refused admission under the terms of subsection (a) of this section, such product shall be refused admission, unless subsection (c) of this section applies and is complied with.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Commission that any consumer product which may be refused admission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section can be so modified that it need not (under the terms of paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) of this section) be refused admission, the Commission may defer final determination as to the admission of such product and, in accordance with such regulations as the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly agree to, permit such product to be delivered from customs custody under bond for the purpose of permitting the owner or consignee an opportunity to so modify such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All actions taken by an owner or consignee to modify such product under subsection (c) of this section shall be subject to the supervision of an officer or employee of the Commission and of the Department of the Treasury. If it appears to the Commission that the product cannot be so modified or that the owner or consignee is not proceeding satisfactorily to modify such product, it shall be refused admission into the customs territory of the United States, and the Commission may direct the Secretary to demand redelivery of the product into customs custody, and to seize the product in accordance with <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2000" section="2071" title="15">section 2071(b) of this title</uscode> if it is not so redelivered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Product destruction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Products refused admission into the customs territory of the United States under this section must be exported, except that upon application, the Secretary of the Treasury may permit the destruction of the product in lieu of exportation. If the owner or consignee does not export the product within a reasonable time, the Department of the Treasury may destroy the product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of expenses occasioned by refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in connection with the destruction provided for in this section (the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury) and all expenses in connection with the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any consumer product refused admission under this section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Importation conditioned upon manufacturer's compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, by rule, condition the importation of a consumer product on the manufacturer's compliance with the inspection and recordkeeping requirements of this chapter and the Commission's rules with respect to such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Product surveillance program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a permanent product surveillance program, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, for the purpose of carrying out the Commission's responsibilities under this chapter and the other Acts administered by the Commission and preventing the entry of unsafe consumer products into the commerce of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may provide to the agencies with which it is cooperating under para<!-- PDFPage:1247 -->graph (1) such information, data, violator lists, test results, and other support, guidance, and documents as may be necessary or helpful for such agencies to cooperate with the Commission to carry out the product surveillance program under paragraph (1).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2069. Civil penalties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who knowingly violates <uscode edition="2000" section="2068" title="15">section 2068 of this title</uscode> shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each such violation. Subject to paragraph (2), a violation of <uscode detail="(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (11)" edition="2000" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (11) of this title</uscode> shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each consumer product involved, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $1,250,000 for any related series of violations. A violation of <uscode detail="(a)(3)" edition="2000" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a)(3) of this title</uscode> shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each failure or refusal to allow or perform an act required thereby; and, if such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $1,250,000 for any related series of violations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to violations of paragraph (1) or (2) of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2000" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a) of this title</uscode>—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the person who violated such paragraphs is not the manufacturer or private labeler or a distributor of the products involved, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such person did not have either (i) actual knowledge that his distribution or sale of the product violated such paragraphs or (ii) notice from the Commission that such distribution or sale would be a violation of such paragraphs.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than December 1, 1994, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately following such publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000, the nearest multiple of $10,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) in the case of penalties greater than $200,000, the nearest multiple of $25,000.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term “Consumer Price Index” means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term “cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years” means the percentage by which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1249 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last adjusted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2000" section="2068" title="15">section 2068(a) of this title</uscode>, the Commission shall consider the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, the number of defective products distributed, and the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any civil penalty under this section may be compromised by the Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, and the number of defective products distributed. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) “Knowingly” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in the first sentence of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the term “knowingly” means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care to ascertain the truth of representations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a consumer product safety standard under this chapter is in effect and applies to a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, no State or political subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to establish or to continue in effect any provision of a safety standard or regulation which prescribes any requirements as to the performance, composition, contents, design, finish, construction, packaging, or labeling of such product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury associated with such consumer product, unless such requirements are identical to the requirements of the Federal standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consumer product safety requirements which impose performance standards more stringent than Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section does not prevent the Federal Government or the government of any State or political subdivision of a State from establishing or continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a consumer product for its own use which requirement is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with the product and which is not identical to the consumer product safety standard applicable to the product under this chapter if the Federal, State, or political subdivision requirement provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the standard applicable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission may by rule, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) of this section (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety standard under this chapter if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard under this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this chapter for such consumer product.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2082. Interim cellulose insulation safety standard</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), on and after the last day of the 60-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C (as such specification was in effect on February 1, 1978), shall be deemed to be an interim consumer product safety standard which shall have all the authority and effect of any other consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under this chapter. During the 45-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the Commission may make, and shall publish in the Federal Register, such technical, nonsubstantive changes in such requirements as it deems appropriate to make such requirements suitable for promulgation as a consumer product safety standard. At the end to the 60-day period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register such interim consumer product safety standard, as altered by the Commission under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interim consumer product safety standard established in paragraph (1) shall provide that any cellulose insulation which is produced or distributed for sale or use as a consumer product shall have a flame spread rating of 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During the period for which the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) of this section is in effect, in addition to complying with any labeling requirement established by the Commission under this <!-- PDFPage:1260 -->chapter, each manufacturer or private labeler of cellulose insulation shall include the following statement on any container of such cellulose insulation: “ATTENTION: This material meets the applicable minimum Federal flammability standard. This standard is based upon laboratory tests only, which do not represent actual conditions which may occur in the home.” Such statement shall be located in a conspicuous place on such container and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, and color with other printed matter on such container.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Judicial review of the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) of this section, as such standard is in effect on and after the last day of the 60-day period specified in such subsection, shall be limited solely to the issue of whether any changes made by the Commission under paragraph (1) are technical, nonsubstantive changes. For purposes of such review, any change made by the Commission under paragraph (1) which requires that any test to determine the flame spread rating of cellulose insulation shall include a correction for variations in test results caused by equipment used in the test shall be considered a technical, nonsubstantive change.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement; violations; promulgation of final standard; procedures applicable to promulgation; revision of interim standard; procedures applicable to revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any interim consumer product safety standard established pursuant to this section shall be enforced in the same manner as any other consumer product safety standard until such time as there is in effect a final consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission, as provided in subparagraph (B), or until such time as it is revoked by the Commission under <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(e) of this title</uscode>. A violation of the interim consumer product safety standard shall be deemed to be a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under <uscode edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines that the interim consumer product safety standard does not adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with flammable or corrosive cellulose insulation, it shall promulgate a final consumer product safety standard to protect against such risk. Such final standard shall be promulgated pursuant to <uscode edition="2000" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation. The provisions of <uscode detail="(b), (c), and (d)" edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(b), (c), and (d) of this title</uscode> shall apply to any proceeding to promulgate such final standard. In any judicial review of such final standard under <uscode edition="2000" section="2060" title="15">section 2060 of this title</uscode>, the court shall not require any demonstration that each particular finding made by the Commission under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2000" section="2058" title="15">section 2058(c) of this title</uscode> is supported by substantial evidence. The court shall affirm the action of the Commission unless the court determines that such action is not supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Until there is in effect such a final consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall incorporate into the interim consumer product safety standard, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, each revision superseding the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness referred to in subsection (a) of this section and promulgated by the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 45 days before any revision superseding such requirements is to become effective, the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall notify the Commission of such revision. In the case of any such revision which becomes effective during the period beginning on February 1, 1978, and ending on July 11, 1978, such notice from the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall be deemed to have been made on July 11, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) No later than 45 days after receiving any notice under subparagraph (B), the Commission shall publish the revision, including such changes in the revision as it considers appropriate to make the revision suitable for promulgation as an amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard, in the Federal Register as a proposed amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Commission may extend the 45-day period specified in clause (i) for an additional period of not more than 150 days if the Commission determines that such extension is necessary to study the technical and scientific basis for the revision involved, or to study the safety and economic consequences of such revision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Additional extensions of the 45-day period specified in subparagraph (C)(i) may be taken by the Commission if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Commission makes the determination required in subparagraph (C)(ii) with respect to each such extension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) in the case of further extensions proposed by the Commission after an initial extension under this clause, such further extensions have not been disapproved under clause (iv).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any extension made by the Commission under this subparagraph shall be for a period of not more than 45 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Prior notice of each extension made by the Commission under this subparagraph, together with a statement of the reasons for such extension and an estimate of the length of time required by the Commission to complete its action upon the revision involved, shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be submitted to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In any case in which the Commission takes an initial 45-day extension under clause (i), the Commission may not take any further extensions under clause (i) if each committee referred to in clause (iii) disapproves by committee resolution any such further extensions before the end of the 15-day period following notice of such initial extension made by the Commission in accordance with clause (iii).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1261 --><p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity to comment upon any proposed amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard during the 30-day period following any publication by the Commission under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) No later than 90 days after the end of the period specified in subparagraph (E), the Commission shall promulgate the amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard unless the Commission determines, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such amendment is not necessary for the protection of consumers from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with flammable or corrosive cellulose insulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) implementation of such amendment will create an undue burden upon persons who are subject to the interim consumer product safety standard.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The provisions of <uscode edition="2000" section="2060" title="15">section 2060 of this title</uscode> shall not apply to any judicial review of any amendment to the interim product safety standard promulgated under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting requirements of other Federal departments, agencies, etc., of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality, or any Federal independent regulatory agency, which obtains information which reasonably indicates that cellulose insulation is being manufactured or distributed in violation of this chapter shall immediately inform the Commission of such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting requirements of Commission to Congressional committees; contents, time of submission, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, no later than 45 days after July 11, 1978, shall submit a report to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives which shall contain a detailed statement of the manner in which the Commission intends to carry out the enforcement of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission, no later than 6 months after the date upon which the report required in paragraph (1) is due (and no later than the end of each 6-month period thereafter), shall submit a report to each committee referred to in paragraph (1) which shall describe the enforcement activities of the Commission with respect to this section during the most recent 6-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The first report which the Commission submits under subparagraph (A) shall include the results of tests of cellulose insulation manufactured by at least 25 manufacturers which the Commission shall conduct to determine whether such cellulose insulation complies with the interim consumer product safety standard. The second such report shall include the results of such tests with respect to 50 manufacturers who were not included in testing conducted by the Commission for inclusion in the first report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with certification requirements; implementation; waiver; rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall have the authority to require that any person required to comply with the certification requirements of <uscode edition="2000" section="2063" title="15">section 2063 of this title</uscode> with respect to the manufacture of cellulose insulation shall provide for the performance of any test or testing program required for such certification through the use of an independent third party qualified to perform such test or testing program. The Commission may impose such requirement whether or not the Commission has established a testing program for cellulose insulation under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2000" section="2063" title="15">section 2063(b) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, upon petition by a manufacturer, may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to such manufacturer if the Commission determines that the use of an independent third party is not necessary in order for such manufacturer to comply with the certification requirements of <uscode edition="2000" section="2063" title="15">section 2063 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may prescribe such rules as it considers necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated, for each of the fiscal years 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
