<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is created a corporation with the name Export-Import Bank of the United States, which shall be an agency of the United States of America. The objects and purposes of the Bank shall be to aid in financing and to facilitate exports of goods and services, imports, and the exchange of commodities and services between the United States or any of its territories or insular possessions and any foreign country or the agencies or nationals of any such country, and in so doing to contribute to the employment of United States workers. The Bank's objective in authorizing loans, guarantees, insurance, and credits shall be to contribute to maintaining or increasing employment of United States workers. In connection with and in furtherance of its objects and purposes, the bank is authorized and empowered to do a general banking business except that of circulation; to receive deposits; to purchase, discount, rediscount, sell, and negotiate, with or without its endorsement or guaranty, and to guarantee notes, drafts, checks, bills of exchange, acceptances, including bankers’ acceptances, cable transfers, and other evidences of indebtedness; to guarantee, insure, coinsure, and reinsure against political and credit risks of loss; to purchase, sell, and guarantee securities but not to purchase with its funds any stock in any other corporation except that it <!-- PDFPage:184 -->may acquire any such stock through the enforcement of any lien or pledge or otherwise to satisfy a previously contracted indebtedness to it; to accept bills and drafts drawn upon it; to issue letters of credit; to purchase and sell coin, bullion, and exchange; to borrow and to lend money; to perform any act herein authorized in participation with any other person, including any individual, partnership, corporation, or association; to adopt, alter, and use a corporate seal, which shall be judicially noticed; to sue and to be sued, to complain and to defend in any court of competent jurisdiction; to represent itself or to contract for representation in all legal and arbitral proceedings outside the United States; and the enumeration of the foregoing powers shall not be deemed to exclude other powers necessary to the achievement of the objects and purposes of the bank. The bank shall be entitled to the use of the United States mails in the same manner and upon the same conditions as the executive departments of the Government. The Bank is authorized to publish or arrange for the publication of any documents, reports, contracts, or other material necessary in connection with or in furtherance of its objects and purposes without regard to the provisions of <uscode edition="2008" section="501" title="44">section 501 of title 44</uscode> whenever the Bank determines that publication in accordance with the provisions of such section would not be practicable. Subject to regulations which the Bank shall issue pursuant to <uscode edition="2008" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>, the Bank may impose and collect reasonable fees to cover the costs of conferences and seminars sponsored by, and publications provided by, the Bank, and may accept reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred by a director, officer, or employee of the Bank, in accordance with subchapter I of <uscode chapter="57" edition="2008" title="5">chapter 57 of title 5</uscode>. Amounts received under the preceding sentence shall be credited to the fund which initially paid for such activities and shall be offset against the expenses of the Bank for such activities. The bank is authorized to use all of its assets and all moneys which have been or may hereafter be allocated to or borrowed by it in the exercise of its functions. Net earnings of the bank after reasonable provision for possible losses shall be used for payment of dividends on capital stock. Any such dividends shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order for the Bank to be competitive in all of its financing programs with countries whose exports compete with United States exports, the Bank shall establish a program that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides medium-term financing where necessary to be fully competitive—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) at rates of interest to the customer which are equal to rates established in international agreements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in amounts up to 85 percent of the total cost of the exports involved; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enables the Bank to cooperate fully with the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to develop a program for purposes of disseminating information (using existing private institutions) to small business concerns regarding the medium-term financing provided under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Enhancement of Medium-Term Program</cap-smallcap>.—To enhance the medium-term financing program established pursuant to paragraph (2), the Bank shall establish measures to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) improve the competitiveness of the Bank's medium-term financing and ensure that its medium-term financing is fully competitive with that of other major official export credit agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ease the administrative burdens and procedural and documentary requirements imposed on the users of medium-term financing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) attract the widest possible participation of private financial institutions and other sources of private capital in the medium-term financing of United States exports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) render the Bank's medium-term financing as supportive of United States exports as is its Direct Loan Program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guarantees, insurance, and extension of credit functions; competitive with Government-supported rates and terms and conditions of foreign exporting countries; survey and report; interest rates; private capital encouragement; national interest determinations; delivery of United States services in international commerce; small business concern encouragement; coverage of losses by Foreign Credit Insurance Association; loans to Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for fossil fuel research, etc.; nuclear safeguards violations resulting in limitations on exports and credit; defense article credit sales to less developed countries; amount outstanding; supplementation of Commodity Credit Corporation programs; limitations on authority of Bank; prohibition relating to Angola</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It is the policy of the United States to foster expansion of exports of manufactured goods, agricultural products, and other goods and services, thereby contributing to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income, a commitment to reinvestment and job creation, and the increased development of the productive resources of the United States. To meet this objective in all its programs, the Export-Import Bank is directed, in the exercise of its functions, to provide guarantees, insurance, and extensions of credit at rates and on terms and other conditions which are fully competitive with the Government-supported rates and terms and other conditions available for the financing of exports of goods and services from the principal countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters, including countries the governments of which are not members of the Arrangement (as defined in section 635i–3(h)(3) of this title). The Bank shall, in cooperation with the export financing instrumentalities of other governments, seek to minimize competition in government-supported export financing and shall, in cooperation with other appropriate United States Government agencies, seek to reach international agreements to reduce government subsidized export financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is further the policy of the United States that loans made by the Bank in all its programs shall bear interest at rates determined by the Board of Directors, consistent with the Bank's <!-- PDFPage:185 -->mandate to support United States exports at rates and on terms and conditions which are fully competitive with exports of other countries, and consistent with international agreements. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, rates and terms and conditions need not be identical in all respects to those offered by foreign countries, but should be established so that the effect of such rates, terms, and conditions for all the Bank's programs, including those for small businesses and for medium-term financing, will be to neutralize the effect of such foreign credit on international sales competition. The Bank shall consider its average cost of money as one factor in its determination of interest rates, where such consideration does not impair the Bank's primary function of expanding United States exports through fully competitive financing. The Bank may not impose a credit application fee unless (i) the fee is competitive with the average fee charged by the Bank's primary foreign competitors, and (ii) the borrower or the exporter is given the option of paying the fee at the outset of the loan or over the life of the loan and the present value of the fee determined under either such option is the same amount. It is also the policy of the United States that the Bank in the exercise of its functions should supplement and encourage, and not compete with, private capital; that the Bank, in determining whether to provide support for a transaction under the loan, guarantee, or insurance program, or any combination thereof, shall consider the need to involve private capital in support of United States exports as well as the cost of the transaction as calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [<uscode edition="2008" section="661" title="2">2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.</uscode>]; that the Bank shall accord equal opportunity to export agents and managers, independent export firms, export trading companies, and small commercial banks in the formulation and implementation of its programs; that the Bank should give emphasis to assisting new and small business entrants in the agricultural export market, and shall, in cooperation with other relevant Government agencies, including the Commodity Credit Corporation, develop a program of education to increase awareness of export opportunities among small agribusinesses and cooperatives; that loans, so far as possible consistent with the carrying out of the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, shall generally be for specific purposes, and, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, offer reasonable assurance of repayment; and that in authorizing any loan or guarantee, the Board of Directors shall take into account any serious adverse effect of such loan or guarantee on the competitive position of United States industry, the availability of materials which are in short supply in the United States, and employment in the United States, and shall give particular emphasis to the objective of strengthening the competitive position of United States exporters and thereby of expanding total United States exports. Only in cases where the President, after consultation with the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, determines that such action would be in the national interest where such action would clearly and importantly advance United States policy in such areas as international terrorism (including, when relevant, a foreign nation's lack of cooperation in efforts to eradicate terrorism), nuclear proliferation, the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the Arms Export Control Act [<uscode edition="2008" section="2751" title="22">22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.</uscode>], the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [<uscode edition="2008" section="1701" title="50">50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.</uscode>], or the Export Administration Act of 1979 [<uscode appendix="2401" detail="et seq." edition="2008" title="50">50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.</uscode>], environmental protection and human rights (such as are provided in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948) (including child labor), should the Export-Import Bank deny applications for credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial considerations. Each such determination shall be delivered in writing to the President of the Bank, shall state that the determination is made pursuant to this section, and shall specify the applications or categories of applications for credit which should be denied by the Bank in furtherance of the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Consistent with the policy of <uscode edition="2008" section="3261" title="22">section 3261 of title 22</uscode> and section 2151q <sup><a href="#635_1_target" name="635_1">1</a></sup> of title 22, the Board of Directors shall name an officer of the Bank whose duties shall include advising the President of the Bank on ways of promoting the export of goods and services to be used in the development, production, and distribution of nonnuclear renewable energy resources, disseminating information concerning export opportunities and the availability of Bank support for such activities, and acting as a liaison between the Bank and the Department of Commerce and other appropriate departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) It is further the policy of the United States to foster the delivery of United States services in international commerce. In exercising its powers and functions, the Bank shall give full and equal consideration to making loans and providing guarantees for the export of services (independently, or in conjunction with the export of manufactured goods, equipment, hardware or other capital goods) consistent with the Bank's policy to neutralize foreign subsidized credit competition and to supplement the private capital market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i)(I) It is further the policy of the United States to encourage the participation of small business in international commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In exercising its authority, the Bank shall develop a program which gives fair consideration to making loans and providing guarantees for the export of goods and services by small businesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) It is further the policy of the United States that the Bank shall give due recognition to the policy stated in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2008" section="631" title="15">section 631(a) of title 15</uscode> that “the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise”.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In furtherance of this policy, the Board of Directors shall designate an officer of the Bank who—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:186 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be responsible to the President of the Bank for all matters concerning or affecting small business concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) among other duties, shall be responsible for advising small business concerns of the opportunities for small business concerns in the functions of the Bank, with particular emphasis on conducting outreach and increasing loans to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in <uscode detail="(a)(4)" edition="2008" section="637" title="15">section 637(a)(4) of title 15</uscode>), small business concerns (as defined in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2008" section="632" title="15">section 632(a) of title 15</uscode>) owned by women, and small business concerns (as defined in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2008" section="632" title="15">section 632(a) of title 15</uscode>) employing fewer than 100 employees, and for maintaining liaison with the Small Business Administration and other departments and agencies in matters affecting small business concerns.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Director appointed to represent the interests of small business under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2008" section="635a" title="12">section 635a(c) of this title</uscode> shall ensure that the Bank carries out its responsibilities under clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph and that the Bank's financial and other resources are, to the maximum extent possible, appropriately used for small business needs.</p>

From the amount made available under the preceding sentence, it shall be a goal of the Bank to increase the amount made available to finance exports directly by small business concerns referred to in <uscode detail="(i)(1)" edition="2008" section="635a" title="12">section 635a(i)(1) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) The Bank shall utilize the amount set aside pursuant to clause (v) of this subparagraph to offer financing for small business exports on terms which are fully competitive with regard to interest rates and with regard to the portion of financing which may be provided, guaranteed, or insured. Financing under this clause (vi) shall be available without regard to whether financing for the particular transaction was disapproved by any other Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii)(I) The Bank shall utilize a part of the amount set aside pursuant to clause (v) to provide lines of credit or guarantees to consortia of small or medium size banks, export trading companies, State export finance agencies, export financing cooperatives, small business investment companies (as defined in <uscode edition="2008" section="662" title="15">section 662 of title 15</uscode>), or other financing institutions or entities in order to finance small business exports.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ix) The Bank shall provide, through creditworthy trade associations, export trading companies, State export finance companies, export finance cooperatives, and other multiple-exporter organizations, medium-term risk protection coverage for the members and clients of such organizations. Such coverage shall be made available to each such organization under a single risk protection policy covering its members or clients. Nothing in this provision shall be interpreted as limiting the Bank's authority to deny support for specific transactions or to disapprove a request by such an organization to participate in such coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(x) The Bank shall implement technology improvements that are designed to improve small business outreach, including allowing customers to use the Internet to apply for the Bank's small business programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) As part of the ongoing marketing and outreach efforts of the Bank, the Bank shall, to the maximum extent practicable, inform high technology companies, particularly small business concerns (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2008" section="632" title="15">section 632 of title 15</uscode>), about the programs of the Bank for United States companies interested in exporting high technology goods to countries making the transition to market based economies, including any eligible East European country (within the meaning of <uscode edition="2008" section="5402" title="22">section 5402 of title 22</uscode>).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) tied aid and partially untied aid credits offered by other countries are a predatory method of financing exports because of their market-distorting effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) these distortions have caused the United States to lose export sales, with resulting losses in economic growth and employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) these practices undermine market mechanisms that would otherwise result in export purchase decisions made on the basis of price, quality, delivery, and other factors directly related to the export, where official financing is not subsidized and would be a neutral factor in the transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) support of commercial exports by donor countries with tied aid and partially untied aid credits impedes the growth of developing countries because it diverts development assistance funds from essential developmental purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Bank has, at a minimum, the following two tasks—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) first, the Bank should match foreign export credit agencies and aid agencies when they engage in tied aid outside the confines of the Arrangement and when they exploit loopholes, such as untied aid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such matching is needed to provide the United States with leverage in efforts at the OECD to reduce the overall level of export subsidies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) only through matching foreign export credit offers can the Bank buttress United States negotiators in their efforts to bring these loopholes within the disciplines of the Arrangement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) in order to bring untied aid within the discipline of the Arrangement, the Bank should consider initiating highly competitive financial support when the Bank learns <!-- PDFPage:218 -->that foreign untied aid offers will be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, the Bank should support United States exporters when the exporters face foreign competition that is consistent with the Arrangement and the Subsidies Code of the World Trade Organization, but which places United States exporters at a competitive disadvantage; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there should be established in the Bank a tied aid program to target the export markets of those countries, including those that are not a party to the Arrangement, which make extensive use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial advantage for the purposes of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) enforcing compliance with the existing Arrangement restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits for commercial purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitating efforts to negotiate, establish, and enforce new or revised comprehensive international arrangements effectively restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promoting compliance with Arrangement rules among foreign export credit agencies that are not a party to the Arrangement;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and such program should be used aggressively for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of tied aid credit program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bank shall establish a tied aid credit program under which grants shall be made from funds available in the Tied Aid Credit Fund established under subsection (c) of this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to supplement the financing of a United States export when there is a reasonable expectation that predatory financing will be provided by another country for a sale by a competitor of the United States exporter with respect to such export and with special attention to matching tied aid and partially untied aid credits extended by other governments—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in violation of the Arrangement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in cases in which the Bank determines that United States trade or economic interests justify the matching of tied aid credits extended in compliance with the Arrangement, including grandfathered cases;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to supplement the financing of United States exports to foreign markets which are actual or potential export markets for any country which the Bank determines—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) engages in predatory official export financing through the use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, and impedes negotiations or violates agreements on tied aid to eliminate the use of such credits for commercial purposes; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) engages in predatory financing practices that seek to circumvent international agreements on tied aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to supplement the financing of United States exports under such other circumstances as the Bank may determine to be appropriate for carrying out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Administration of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tied aid credit program shall be administered by the Bank—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in consultation with the Secretary and in accordance with the principles, process, and standards developed pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection and the purposes described in subsection (a)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in cooperation with United States exporters and private financial institutions or entities, and in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with other export financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under the tied aid credit program, the Bank may combine grants from the Tied Aid Credit Fund with—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any guarantee, insurance, or other extension of credit provided by the Bank under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any export financing provided by any private financial institution or other entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any other type of export financing,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in such manner and under such terms as the Bank determines to be appropriate, including combinations of export financing in the form of blended financing and parallel financing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information on countries which engage in official predatory export financing and impede negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to assist the Bank to make the most efficient use of funds available for supplemental financing under paragraph (1)(B), the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce may provide information on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B) to the Bank, the Secretary, and the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies. The Bank shall also request and take into consideration the views of the private sector on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Principles, process, and standards governing use of the Fund</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary and the Bank jointly shall develop a process for, and the principles and standards to be used in, determining how the amounts in the Tied Aid Credit Fund could be used most effectively and efficiently to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(6) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Content of principles, process, and standards</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Consideration of certain principles and standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In developing the principles and standards referred to in subparagraph (A), the <!-- PDFPage:219 -->Secretary and the Bank shall consider administering the Tied Aid Credit Fund in accordance with the following principles and standards:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The Tied Aid Credit Fund should be used to leverage multilateral negotiations to restrict the scope for aid-financed trade distortions through new multilateral rules, to police existing rules, and to seek compliance by those countries that are not a party to the Arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) The Tied Aid Credit Fund will be used to counter a foreign tied aid credit confronted by a United States exporter when bidding for a capital project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) Credible information about an offer of foreign tied aid will be required before the Tied Aid Credit Fund is used to offer specific terms to match such an offer. In cases where information about a specific offer of foreign tied aid (or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid) is not available in a timely manner, or is unavailable because the foreign export credit agency involved is not subject to the reporting requirements under the Arrangement, then the Bank may decide to use the Tied Aid Credit Fund based on credible evidence of a history of such offers under similar circumstances or other forms of credible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) The Tied Aid Credit Fund will be used to enable a competitive United States exporter to pursue further market opportunities on commercial terms made possible by the use of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) Each use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund will be in accordance with the Arrangement unless a breach of the Arrangement has been committed by a foreign export credit agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) The Tied Aid Credit Fund may only be used to defend potential sales by United States companies to a project that is environmentally sound.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) The Tied Aid Credit Fund may be used to preemptively counter potential foreign tied aid offers without triggering foreign tied aid use.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In handling individual applications involving the use or potential use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund the following process shall exclusively apply pursuant to subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The Bank shall process an application for tied aid in accordance with the principles and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A) and clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Twenty days prior to the scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors at which an application will be considered (unless the Bank determines that an earlier discussion is appropriate based on the facts of a particular financing), the Bank shall brief the Secretary on the application and deliver to the Secretary such documents, information, or data as may reasonably be necessary to permit the Secretary to review the application to determine if the application complies with the principles and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A) and clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The Secretary may request a single postponement of the consideration by the Board of Directors of the application for up to 14 days to allow the Secretary to submit to the Board of Directors a memorandum objecting to the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) Case-by-case decisions on whether to approve the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund shall be made by the Board of Directors, except that the approval of the Board of Directors (or a commitment letter based on that approval) shall not become final (except as provided in subclause (V)), if the Secretary indicates to the President of the Bank in writing the Secretary's intention to appeal the decision of the Board of Directors to the President of the United States and makes the appeal in writing not later than 20 days after the meeting at which the Board of Directors considered the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) The Bank shall not grant final approval of an application for any tied aid credit (or a commitment letter based on that approval) if the President of the United States, after consulting with the President of the Bank and the Secretary, determines within 30 days of an appeal by the Secretary under subclause (IV) that the extension of the tied aid credit would materially impede achieving the purposes described in subsection (a)(6). If no such Presidential determination is made during the 30-day period, the approval by the Bank of the application (or related commitment letter) that was the subject of such appeal shall become final.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Initial principles, process, and standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as is practicable but not later than 6 months after June 14, 2002, the Secretary and the Bank shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a copy of the principles, process, and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Transitional principles and standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The principles and standards set forth in subparagraph (B)(i) shall govern the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund until the principles, process, and standards required by subparagraph (C) are submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Update and revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary and the Bank jointly should update and revise, as needed, the principles, process, and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A), and, on doing so, shall submit to the Committee on Financial Serv<!-- PDFPage:220 -->ices of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a copy of the principles, process, and standards so updated and revised.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Reconsideration of decisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Taking into consideration the time sensitivity of transactions, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall expeditiously pursuant to paragraph (2) reconsider a decision of the Board to deny an application for the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund if the applicant submits the request for reconsideration within 3 months of the denial.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedural rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any such reconsideration, the applicant may be required to provide new information on the application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tied Aid Credit Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby established within the Bank a fund to be known as the “Tied Aid Credit Fund” (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Fund”), consisting of such amounts as may be appropriated to the Fund pursuant to the authorization contained in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expenditures from Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts in the Fund shall be available for grants made by the Bank under the tied aid credit program established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and to reimburse the Bank for the amount equal to the concessionality level of any tied aid credits authorized by the Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consistency with Arrangement</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Environmental effects consideration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with the objectives of <uscode detail="(b)(1)(A)" edition="2008" section="635" title="12">section 635(b)(1)(A) of this title</uscode>, the Bank shall establish procedures to take into account the potential beneficial and adverse environmental effects of goods and services for which support is requested under its direct lending and guarantee programs. Such procedures shall provide for the public disclosure of environmental assessments and supplemental environmental reports required to be submitted to the Bank, including remediation or mitigation plans and procedures, and related monitoring reports. <!-- PDFPage:223 -->The preceding sentence shall not be interpreted to require the public disclosure of any information described in <uscode edition="2008" section="1905" title="18">section 1905 of title 18</uscode>. Such procedures shall apply to any transaction involving a project—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which long-term support of $10,000,000 or more is requested from the Bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for which the Bank's support would be critical to its implementation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which may have significant environmental effects upon the global commons or any country not participating in the project, or may produce an emission, an effluent, or a principal product that is prohibited or strictly regulated pursuant to Federal environmental law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to withhold financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The procedures established under paragraph (1) shall permit the Board of Directors, in its judgment, to withhold financing from a project for environmental reasons or to approve financing after considering the potential environmental effects of a project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of Bank programs to encourage certain exports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bank shall encourage the use of its programs to support the export of goods and services that have beneficial effects on the environment or mitigate potential adverse environmental effects (such as exports of products and services used to aid in the monitoring, abatement, control, or prevention of air, water, and ground contaminants or pollution, or which provide protection in the handling of toxic substances, subject to a final determination by the Bank, and products and services for foreign environmental projects dedicated entirely to the prevention, control, or cleanup of air, water, or ground pollution, including facilities to provide for control or cleanup, and used in the retrofitting of facility equipment for the sole purpose of mitigating, controlling, or preventing adverse environmental effects, subject to a final determination by the Bank). The Board of Directors shall name an officer of the Bank to advise the Board on ways that the Bank's programs can be used to support the export of such goods and services. The officer shall act as liaison between the Bank and other Federal Government agencies, including the agencies whose representatives are members of the Environmental Trade Promotion Working Group of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, with respect to overall United States Government policy on the environment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to other funds available to support the export of goods and services described in paragraph (1), there are authorized to be appropriated to the Bank not more than $35,000,000 for the cost (as defined in <uscode detail="(5)" edition="2008" section="661a" title="2">section 661a(5) of title 2</uscode>) of supporting such exports. If, in any fiscal year, the funds appropriated in accordance with this paragraph are not fully utilized due to insufficient qualified transactions for the export of such goods and services, such funds may be expended for other purposes eligible for support by the Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Inclusion in report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bank shall provide in its annual report to the Congress a summary of its activities under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interpretation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any cause of action.</p>
