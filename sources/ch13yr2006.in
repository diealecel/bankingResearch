<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem be<!-- PDFPage:445 -->cause of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and model code development and promulgation, and information dissemination. These existing activities should be encouraged and these capabilities effectively utilized wherever possible and appropriate to the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress declares that an authoritative nongovernmental instrument needs to be created to address the problems and issues described in paragraph (1), that the creation of such an instrument should be initiated by the Government, with the advice and assistance of the National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering-National Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the “Academies-Research Council”) and of the various sectors of the building community, including labor and management, technical experts in building science and technology, and the various levels of government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is authorized to be established, for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3) of this section, an appropriate nonprofit, nongovernmental instrument to be known as the National Institute of Building Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the “Institute”), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government. The Institute shall be subject to the provisions of this section and, to the extent consistent with this section, to a charter of the Congress if such a charter is requested and issued or to the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act if that is deemed preferable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Academies-Research Council, along with other agencies and organizations which are knowledgeable in the field of building technology, shall advise and assist in (A) the establishment of the Institute; (B) the development of an organizational framework to encourage and provide for the maximum feasible participation of public and private scientific, technical, and financial organizations, institutions, and agencies now engaged in activities pertinent to the development, promulgation, and maintenance of performance criteria, standards, and other technical provisions for building codes and other regulations; and (C) the promulgation of appropriate organizational rules and procedures including those for the selection and operation of a technical staff, such rules and procedures to be based upon the primary object of promoting the public interest and insuring that the widest possible variety of interests and experience essential to the functions of the Institute are represented in the Institute's operations. Recommendations of the Academies-Research Council shall be based upon consultations with and recommendations from various private organizations and institutions, labor, private industry, and governmental agencies entities operating in the field, and the Consultative Council as provided for under subsection (c)(8) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as expressing the intent of the Congress that the Academies-Research Council itself be required to assume any function or operation vested in the Institute by or under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by <!-- PDFPage:453 -->expanding the supply of supportive housing that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is designed to accommodate the special needs of elderly persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides a range of services that are tailored to the needs of elderly persons occupying such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Such assistance shall be provided as (1) capital advances in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section, and (2) contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with subsection (c)(2) of this section. Such assistance may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure, or the acquisition of a structure, to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with this section. Assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forms of assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A capital advance provided under this section shall bear no interest and its repayment shall not be required so long as the housing remains available for very low-income elderly persons in accordance with this section. Such advance shall be in an amount calculated in accordance with the development cost limitation established in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Project rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contracts for project rental assistance shall obligate the Secretary to make monthly payments to cover any part of the costs attributed to units occupied (or, as approved by the Secretary, held for occupancy) by very low-income elderly persons that is not met from project income. The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units so occupied and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Tenant rent contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A very low-income person shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this section the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar: (A) 30 percent of the person's adjusted monthly income, (B) 10 percent of the person's monthly income, or (C) if the person is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the person's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Term of commitment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All units in housing assisted under this section shall be made available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for not less than 40 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contract terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial term of a contract entered into under subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be 240 months. The Secretary shall, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, extend any expiring contract for a term of not less than 60 months. In order to facilitate the orderly extension of expiring contracts, the Secretary is authorized to make commitments to extend expiring contracts during the year prior to the date of expiration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds made available under this section shall be allocated by the Secretary among approvable applications submitted by private nonprofit organizations. Applications for assistance under this section shall be submitted by an applicant in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish. Such applications shall contain—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the proposed housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the assistance the applicant seeks under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of the resources that are expected to be made available in compliance with subsection (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of (A) the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve; (B) the supportive services, if any, to be provided to the persons occupying such housing; (C) the manner in which such services will be provided to such persons, including, in the case of frail elderly persons, evidence of such residential supervision as the Secretary determines is necessary to facilitate the adequate provision of such services; and (D) the public or private sources of assistance that can reasonably be expected to fund or provide such services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a certification from the public official responsible for submitting a housing strategy for the jurisdiction to be served in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="12705" title="42">section 12705 of title 42</uscode> that the proposed project is consistent with the approved housing strategy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other information or certifications that the Secretary determines to be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall not reject an application on technical grounds without giving notice of that rejection and the basis therefor to the applicant and affording the applicant an opportunity to respond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish selection criteria for assistance under this section, which shall include—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:454 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ability of the applicant to develop and operate the proposed housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the need for supportive housing for the elderly in the area to be served, taking into consideration the availability of public housing for the elderly and vacancy rates in such facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which the proposed size and unit mix of the housing will enable the applicant to manage and operate the housing efficiently and ensure that the provision of supportive services will be accomplished in an economical fashion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which the proposed design of the housing will meet the special physical needs of elderly persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the extent to which the applicant has demonstrated that the supportive services identified in subsection (e)(4) of this section will be provided on a consistent, long-term basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the extent to which the proposed design of the housing will accommodate the provision of supportive services that are expected to be needed, either initially or over the useful life of the housing, by the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that funds made available under this section are used effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Provisions of services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that housing assisted under this section provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the category or categories of elderly persons (including frail elderly persons) occupying such housing. Such services may include (A) meal service adequate to meet nutritional need; (B) housekeeping aid; (C) personal assistance; (D) transportation services; (E) health-related services; (F) providing education and outreach regarding telemarketing fraud, in accordance with the standards issued under section 671(f) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (<uscode detail="(f)" edition="2006" section="13631" title="42">42 U.S.C. 13631(f)</uscode>); and (G) such other services as the Secretary deems essential for maintaining independent living. The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Local coordination of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that owners have the managerial capacity to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assess on an ongoing basis the service needs of residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) coordinate the provision of supportive services and tailor such services to the individual needs of residents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek on a continuous basis new sources of assistance to ensure the long-term provision of supportive services.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any cost associated with this subsection shall be an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service coordinators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any cost associated with employing or otherwise retaining a service coordinator in housing assisted under this section shall be considered an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2) of this section. If a project is receiving congregate housing services assistance under <uscode edition="2006" section="8011" title="42">section 8011 of title 42</uscode>, the amount of costs provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section for the project service coordinator may not exceed the additional amount necessary to cover the costs of providing for the coordination of services for residents of the project who are not eligible residents under such <uscode edition="2006" section="8011" title="42">section 8011 of title 42</uscode>. To the extent that amounts are available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of this section for the costs of carrying out this paragraph within a project, an owner of housing assisted under this section shall provide a service coordinator for the housing to coordinate the provision of services under this subsection within the housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Development cost limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall periodically establish development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for the elderly by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for the elderly that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost of movables necessary to the basic operation of the housing, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the cost of special design features necessary to make the housing accessible to elderly persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the physical needs of elderly project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the cost of congregate space necessary to accommodate the provision of supportive services to elderly project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) if the housing is newly constructed, the cost of meeting the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="12709" title="42">section 12709 of title 42</uscode>; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the cost of land, including necessary site improvement.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In establishing development cost limitations for a given market area under this subsection, the Secretary shall use data that reflect currently prevailing costs of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, and land acquisition in the area. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “congregate space” shall include space for cafeterias or dining halls, community rooms or buildings, workshops, adult day health facilities, or other outpatient health facilities, or other essential service facilities.

<p class="note-body">Section 162(a) of <plaw congress="100" isprivate="false" number="242">Pub. L. 100–242</plaw> provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">“(1) The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) housing for nonelderly handicapped families is assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701q" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701q</uscode>] and section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1437f</uscode>];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(B) the housing programs under such sections are designed and implemented primarily to assist rental housing for elderly and nonelderly families and are often inappropriate for dealing with the specialized needs of the physically impaired, the developmentally disabled, and the chronically mentally ill;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(C) the development of housing for nonelderly handicapped families under such programs is often more expensive than necessary, thereby reducing the number of such families that can be assisted with available funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(D) the program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 can continue to provide direct loans to finance group residences and independent apartments for nonelderly handicapped families, but can be made more efficient and less costly by the adoption of standards and procedures applicable only to housing for such families;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(E) the cost containment policies currently being implemented in the development of small group homes (i) do not adequately reflect the necessity for building designs to meet the needs of the designated residents; and (ii) do not recognize necessary State and local standards for the operation of such homes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(F) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families is time consuming and unnecessarily costly and, in some areas of the Nation, prevents the development of such housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(G) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families should be replaced by a more appropriate subsidy mechanism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(H) both elderly and handicapped housing projects assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 will benefit from an increased emphasis on supportive services and a greater use of State and local funds; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(I) an improved program for nonelderly handicapped families will assist in providing shelter and supportive services for mentally ill persons who might otherwise be homeless.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(2) The purpose of this section is to improve the direct loan program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 to ensure that such program meets the special housing and related needs of nonelderly handicapped families.”</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is a large and growing need for suitable housing for older people both in urban and rural areas. Our older citizens face special problems in meeting their <!-- PDFPage:469 -->housing needs because of the prevalence of modest and limited incomes among the elderly, their difficulty in obtaining liberal long-term home mortgage credit, and their need for housing planned and designed to include features necessary to the safety and convenience of the occupants in a suitable neighborhood environment. The Congress further finds that the present programs for housing the elderly under the Department of Housing and Urban Development have proven the value of Federal credit assistance in this field and at the same time demonstrated the urgent need for an expanded and more comprehensive effort to meet our responsibilities to our senior citizens.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; maximum term; maximum aggregate amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the “Sec<!-- PDFPage:470 -->retary”) is authorized to make, and contract to make, annual payments to a “housing owner” on behalf of “qualified tenants”, as those terms are defined herein, in such amounts and under such circumstances as are prescribed in or pursuant to this section. In no case shall a contract provide for such payments with respect to any housing for a period exceeding forty years. The aggregate amount of the contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $150,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $40,000,000, on July 1, 1969, by $100,000,000 on July 1, 1970, and by $40,000,000 on July 1, 1971.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) “Housing owner” defined; limitation on payments to housing owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term “housing owner” means a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is a mortgagor under section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715</uscode><em>l</em>(d)(3)] and which, after August 10, 1965, has been approved for mortgage insurance thereunder and has been approved for receiving the benefits of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That, except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, no payments under this section may be made with respect to any property financed with a mortgage receiving the benefits of the interest rate provided for in the proviso in section 221(d)(5) of that Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715</uscode><em>l</em>(d)(5)]. Such term also includes a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is the owner of a rental or cooperative housing project financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatement and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. Subject to the limitations provided in subsection (j) of this section, the term “housing owner” also has the meaning prescribed in such subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing payments to a housing owner with respect to projects in which all or part of the dwelling units do not contain kitchen facilities; but of the total amount of contracts to make annual payments approved in appropriation Acts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section after December 31, 1970, not more than 10 per centum in the aggregate shall be made with respect to such projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) “qualified tenant” means any individual or family having an income which would qualify such individual or family for assistance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">section 1437f of title 42</uscode>, except that such term shall also include any individual or family who was receiving assistance under this section on the day preceding December 21, 1979, so long as such individual or family continues to meet the conditions for such assistance which were in effect on such day; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) “income” means income from all sources of each member of the household, as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary. In determining amounts to be excluded from income, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, take into account the number of minor children in the household and such other factors as the Secretary may determine are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The terms “qualified tenant” and “tenant” include a member of a cooperative who satisfies the foregoing requirements and who, upon resale of his membership to the cooperative, will not be reimbursed for any equity increment accumulated through payments under this section. With respect to members of a cooperative, the terms “rental” and “rental charges” mean the charges under the occupancy agreements between such members and the cooperative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Annual payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the annual payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the lesser of (1) 70 per centum of the fair market rent, or (2) the amount by which the fair market rental for such unit exceeds 30 per centum of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Criteria and procedure for determining eligibility and rental charges; recertification of income; agreements for services required in selection of tenants; delegation of authority to issue certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall establish criteria and procedures for determining the eligibility of occupants and rental charges, including criteria and procedures with respect to periodic review of tenant incomes and periodic adjustment of rental charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Procedures adopted by the Secretary hereunder shall provide for recertifications of the incomes of occupants no less frequently than annually for the purpose of adjusting rental charges and annual payments on the basis of occupants’ incomes, but in no event shall rental charges adjusted under this section for any dwelling exceed the fair market rental of the dwelling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may enter into agreements, or authorize housing owners to enter into agreements, with public or private agencies for services required in the selection of qualified tenants, including those who may be approved, on the basis of the probability of future increases in their incomes, as lessees under an option to purchase (which will give such approved qualified tenants an exclusive right to purchase at a price established or determined as provided in the option) dwellings, and in the establishment of rentals. The Secretary is authorized (without limiting his authority under any other provision of law) to delegate to any such public or private agency his authority to issue certificates pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No payments under this section may be made with respect to any property for which the costs of operation (including wages and salaries) are determined by the Secretary to be greater than similar costs of operation of similar housing in the community where the property is situated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with respect to any housing assisted under this section, section 221(d)(3), section 231(c)(3), or section 236 of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715</uscode><em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715v(c)(3), 1715z–1], or <uscode edition="2006" section="1701q" title="12">section 1701q of this title</uscode>, including the authority to prescribe occupancy requirements under other provisions of law or to determine the portion of such housing which may be occupied by qualified tenants. To ensure that qualified tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this section immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under this section, the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into with owners of projects assisted under this section but not subject to mortgages insured under title II of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1707" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.</uscode>] to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of qualified tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1437c" title="42">section 1437c(c) of title 42</uscode>. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, such sums as may be necessary to make annual payments as prescribed in this section, pay for services provided under (or pursuant to agreements entered into under) subsection (e) of this section, and provide administrative expenses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress affirms the national goal, as set forth in <uscode edition="2006" section="1441" title="42">section 1441 of title 42</uscode>, of “a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family”.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:474 --><p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that this goal has not been fully realized for many of the Nation's lower income families; that this is a matter of grave national concern; and that there exist in the public and private sectors of the economy the resources and capabilities necessary to the full realization of this goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that in the administration of those housing programs authorized by this Act which are designed to assist families with incomes so low that they could not otherwise decently house themselves, and of other Government programs designed to assist in the provision of housing for such families, the highest priority and emphasis should be given to meeting the housing needs of those families for which the national goal has not become a reality; and in the carrying out of such programs there should be the fullest practicable utilization of the resources and capabilities of private enterprise and of individual self-help techniques.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the employment and other economic opportunities generated by projects and activities that receive Federal housing and community development assistance offer an effective means of empowering low- and very low-income persons, particularly persons who are recipients of government assistance for housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prior Federal efforts to direct employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal housing and community development programs to low- and very low-income persons have not been fully effective and should be intensified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this section to ensure that the employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that Federal aids to housing have not contributed fully to improvement in architectural standards. This objective has been contemplated in Federal housing legislation since the establishment of mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress commends the Department of Housing and Urban Development for its recent efforts to improve architectural standards through competitive design awards and in other ways but at the same time recognizes that this important objective requires high priority if Federal aid is to make its full communitywide contribution toward improving our urban environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that even within the necessary budget limitations on housing for low and moderate income families architectural design could be improved not only to make the housing more attractive, but to make it better suited to the needs of occupants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that in the administration of housing programs which assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, emphasis should be given to encouraging good design as an essential component of such housing and to developing housing which will be of such quality as to reflect its important relationship to the architectural standards of the neighborhood and community in which it is situated, consistent with prudent budgeting.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Institution of program; assistance to mobile home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the use of new housing technologies in providing decent, safe, and sanitary housing for lower income families; to encourage large-scale experimentation in the use <!-- PDFPage:488 -->of such technologies; to provide a basis for comparison of such technologies with existing housing technologies in providing such housing; and to evaluate the effect of local housing codes and zoning regulations on the large-scale use of new housing technologies in the provision of such housing, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the “Secretary”) shall institute a program under which qualified organizations, public and private, will submit plans for the development of housing for lower income families, using new and advanced technologies, on Federal land which has been made available by the Secretary for the purposes of this section, or on other land where (1) local building regulations permit the construction of experimental housing, or (2) State or local law permits variances from building regulations in the construction of experimental housing for the purpose of testing and developing new building technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval of plans utilizing new housing technologies; considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall approve not more than five plans utilizing new housing technologies which are submitted to him pursuant to the program referred to in subsection (a) of this section and which he determines are most promising in furtherance of the purposes of this section. In making such determination the Secretary shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the potential of the technology employed for producing housing for lower income families on a large scale at a moderate cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which the plan envisages environmental quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the possibility of mass production of the technology; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the financial soundness of the organization submitting the plan, and the ability of such organization, alone or in combination with other organizations, to produce at least one thousand dwelling units a year utilizing the technology proposed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Number of dwelling units to be constructed for each type of technology; evaluation of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving projects for mortgage insurance under <uscode detail="(a)(2)" edition="2006" section="1715x" title="12">section 1715x(a)(2) of this title</uscode>, the Secretary shall seek to achieve the construction of at least one thousand dwelling units a year over a five-year period for each of the various types of technologies proposed in approved plans under subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary shall evaluate each project with respect to which assistance is extended pursuant to this section with a view to determining (1) the detailed cost breakdown per dwelling unit, (2) the environmental quality achieved in each unit, and (3) the effect which local housing codes and zoning regulations have, or would have if applicable, on the cost per dwelling unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of surplus property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, any land which is excess property within the meaning of such Act and which is determined by the Secretary to be suitable in furtherance of the purposes of this section may be transferred to the Secretary upon his request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Report of findings; legislative recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, at the earliest practicable date, report his findings with respect to projects assisted pursuant to this section (including evaluations of each such project in accordance with subsection (c) of this section), together with such recommendations for additional legislation as he determines to be necessary or desirable to expand the available supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing for lower income families through the use of technologies the efficacy of which has been demonstrated under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants for arrest of incipient abandonment and revitalization of blighted areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out activities under section 1701z–1 of this title, the Secretary may undertake programs to demonstrate the most feasible means of providing assistance to localities in which a substantial number of structures are abandoned or are threatened with abandonment for the purpose of arresting the process of housing abandonment in its incipiency or in restoring viability to blighted areas in which abandonment is pervasive. For this purpose, the Secretary is authorized to make grants, subject to the limitations of this section, to assist local public bodies in planning and implementing demonstration projects for prompt and effective action in alleviating and preventing such abandonment in designated demonstration areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preferred projects; scope of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering this section, the Secretary shall give preference to those demonstration projects which in his judgment can reasonably be expected to arrest the process of abandonment in the demonstration area within a period of two years and which provide for innovative approaches to combating the problem of housing abandonment. Such projects may include, but shall not be limited to (1) acquisition by negotiated purchase, lease, receivership, tax lien proceedings, or other means authorized by law and satisfactory to the Secretary, of real property within the demonstration area or areas which is abandoned, deteriorated, or in violation of applicable code standards; (2) the repair of streets, sidewalks, parks, playgrounds, publicly owned utilities, public buildings to meet needs consistent with the revitalization and continued use of the area; (3) the demolition of structures determined to be structurally unsound or unfit for human habitation or which contribute adversely to the physical or social environment of the locality involved; (4) the establishment of recreational or community facilities including public playgrounds; (5) the improvement of garbage and trash collection, street cleaning and other essential services necessary to the revitalization and maintenance of the area; (6) the rehabilitation of privately and publicly owned real property by the locality; and (7) the establishment and operation of locally controlled, nonprofit housing management corporations and municipal repair programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purchase or lease of project real estate at fair market value for new or rehabilitated housing use; conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, real property held as part of a project assisted under this section may be made available to (1) a limited dividend corporation, nonprofit corporation, or association, cooperative or public body or agency, or other approved purchaser or lessee, or (2) a purchaser who would be eligible for a mortgage insured under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) or (d)(4), section 1715<em>l</em>(h)(1), section 1715z(i) or (j)(1), or section 1715z–1 of this title, for purchase or lease at fair market value for use by such purchaser or lessee, as, or in the provision of, new or rehabilitated housing for occupancy by families or individuals of low or moderate income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of grants; authorization of appropriations; continuing availability of funds; locality limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants under this section shall be in amounts which do not exceed 90 per centum of the net project cost as determined by the Secretary. There are authorized to be appropriated for demonstration grants under this section not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971. Any amounts appropriated shall remain available until expended and any amount authorized but not appropriated may be appropriated for any succeeding fiscal year commencing prior to July 1, 1972. Not more than one-third of the aggregate amount of grants made in any fiscal year under this section shall be made with respect to projects undertaken by one locality.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sales prices for such mortgages shall be, in the determination of the Secretary, the best prices that may be obtained for such mortgages from a unit of general local government or State agency, consistent with the expectation and intention that the projects financed will be retained for use under the applicable mortgage insurance program for the life of the initial mortgage insurance contract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sale of mortgages covering unsubsidized projects</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized and empowered upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure banks, trust companies, personal finance companies, mortgage companies, building and loan associations, installment lending companies and other such financial institutions, which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities and approves as eligible for credit insurance, against losses which they may sustain as a result of loans and advances of credit, and purchases of obligations representing loans and advances of credit, made by them on and after July 1, 1939, for the purpose of (i) financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures or manufactured homes, and the building of new structures, upon urban, suburban, or rural real property (including the restoration, rehabilitation, rebuilding, and replacement of such improvements which have been damaged or destroyed by earthquake, conflagration, tornado, hurricane, cyclone, flood, or other catastrophe), by the owners thereof or by lessees of such real property under a lease expiring not less than six months after the maturity of the loan or advance of credit; and for the purpose of (ii) financing the purchase of a manufactured home to be used by the owner as his principal residence or financing the purchase of a lot on which to place such home and paying expenses reasonably necessary for the appropriate preparation of such lot, including the installation of utility connections, sanitary facilities, and paving, and the construction of a suitable pad, or financing only the acquisition of such a lot either with or without such preparation by an owner of a manufactured home; and for the purpose of financing the preservation of historic structures, and, as used in this section, the term “historic structures” means residential structures which are registered in the National Register of Historic Places or which are certified by the Secretary of the Interior to conform to National Register criteria; and the term “preservation” means restoration or rehabilitation undertaken for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary in regulations issued by him, after consulting with the Secretary of the Interior. In no case shall the insurance granted by the Secretary under this section to any such financial institution on loans, advances of credit, and pur<!-- PDFPage:512 -->chases made by such financial institution for such purposes on and after July 1, 1939, exceed 10 per centum of the total amount of such loans, advances of credit, and purchases: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to any loan, advance of credit, or purchase made after August 2, 1954, the amount of any claim for loss on any such individual loan, advance of credit or purchase paid by the Secretary under the provisions of this section to a lending institution shall not exceed 90 per centum of such loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">After August 2, 1954, (i) the Secretary shall not enter into contracts for insurance pursuant to this section except with lending institutions which are subject to the inspection and supervision of a governmental agency required by law to make periodic examinations of their books and accounts, and which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases, and with such other lending institutions which the Secretary approves as eligible for insurance pursuant to this section on the basis of their credit and their experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases; (ii) only such items as substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of properties shall be eligible for financing under this section, and therefore the Secretary shall from time to time declare ineligible for financing under this section any item, product, alteration, repair, improvement, or class thereof which he determines would not substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of such properties, and he may also declare ineligible for financing under this section any item which he determines is especially subject to selling abuses; and (iii) the Secretary is authorized and directed, by such regulations or procedures as he shall deem advisable, to prevent the use of any financial assistance under this section (1) with respect to new residential structures (other than manufactured homes) that have not been completed and occupied for at least six months, or (2) which would, through multiple loans, result in an outstanding aggregate loan balance with respect to the same structure exceeding the dollar amount limitation prescribed in this subsection for the type of loan involved: <em>Provided</em>, That this clause (iii) may in the discretion of the Secretary be waived with respect to the period of occupancy or completion of any such new residential structures. The Secretary is hereby authorized and directed, with respect to manufactured homes to be financed under this section, to (i) prescribe minimum property standards to assure the livability and durability of the manufactured home and the suitability of the site on which the manufactured home is to be located; and (ii) obtain assurances from the borrower that the manufactured home will be placed on a site which complies with the standards prescribed by the Secretary and with local zoning and other applicable local requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance authority provided under this section may be made available with respect to any existing manufactured home that has not been insured under this section if such home was constructed in accordance with the standards issued under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 [<uscode edition="2006" section="5401" title="42">42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.</uscode>] and it meets standards similar to the minimum property standards applicable to existing homes insured under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may include the provision of fire safety equipment, energy conserving improvements, or the installation of solar energy systems. Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may also include the evaluation and reduction of lead-based paint hazards. As used in this section—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term “energy conserving improvements” means the purchase and installation of weatherization materials as defined in <uscode detail="(9)" edition="2006" section="6862" title="42">section 6862(9) of title 42</uscode>; and <sup><a href="#1703_1_target" name="1703_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term “solar energy system” means any addition, alteration, or improvement to an existing or new structure which is designed to utilize wind energy or solar energy either of the active type based on mechanically forced energy transfer or of the passive type based on convective, conductive, or radiant energy transfer or some combination of these types to reduce the energy requirements of that structure from other energy sources, and which is in conformity with such criteria and standards as shall be prescribed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy.<sup><a href="#1703_2_target" name="1703_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms “evaluation”, “reduction”, and “lead-based paint hazard” have the same meanings given those terms in <uscode edition="2006" section="4851b" title="42">section 4851b of title 42</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Because of prevailing higher costs, the Secretary may, by regulation, in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii, increase any dollar amount limitation on manufactured homes or manufactured home lot loans contained in this subsection by not to exceed 40 per centum. In other areas, the maximum dollar amounts specified in subsections (b)(1)(D) and (b)(1)(E) of this section may be increased on an area-by-area basis to the extent the Secretary deems necessary, but in no case may such limits, as so increased, exceed the lesser of (A) 185 percent of the dollar amount specified, or (B) the dollar amount specified as increased by the same percentage by which 95 percent of the median one-family house price in the area (as determined by the Secretary) exceeds $67,500.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it if the term to maturity of such loan, advance of credit or purchase exceeds—</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it unless the obligation has such maturity, bears such insurance premium charges, and contains such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary shall prescribe, in order to make credit available for the purpose of this subchapter. Any such obligation with respect to which insurance is granted under this section shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the financial institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) With respect to the financing of alterations, repairs, and improvements to existing structures or the building of new structures as authorized under clause (i) of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section, any loan broker (as defined by the Secretary) or any other party having a financial interest in the making of such a loan or advance of credit or in providing assistance to the borrower in preparing the loan application or otherwise assisting the borrower in obtaining the loan or advance of credit who knowingly (as defined in section 1735f–14(g) of this title) submits to any such financial institution or to the Secretary false information shall be subject to a civil money penalty in the amount and manner provided under section 1735f–14 of this title with respect to mortgagees and lenders under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall have the power, under regulations to be prescribed by him and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, to assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this section, and to collect or compromise all obligations assigned to or held by him and all legal or equitable rights accruing to him in connection with the payment of such insurance until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection.</p>

The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter may be exercised by an officer appointed by him without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer or agent he may appoint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary is authorized and empowered, under such regulations as he may prescribe, to transfer to any such approved financial institution any insurance in connection with any loans and advances of credit which may be sold to it by another approved financial institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary is authorized to waive compliance with regulations heretofore or hereafter prescribed by him with respect to the interest and maturity of and the terms, conditions, and restrictions under which loans, advances of credit, and purchases may be insured under this section and section 1706a <sup><a href="#1703_4_target" name="1703_4">4</a></sup> of this title, if in his judgment the enforcement of such regulations would impose an injustice upon an insured institution which has substantially complied with such regulations in good faith and refunded or credited any excess charge made, and where such waiver does not involve an increase of the obligation of the Secretary beyond the obligation which would have been involved if the regulations had been fully complied with.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall fix a premium charge for the insurance hereafter granted under this section, but in the case of any obligation representing any loan, advance of credit, or purchase, such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the net proceeds of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase, for the term of such obligation, and such premium charge shall be payable in advance by the financial institution and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any payment for loss made to an approved financial institution under this section shall be final and incontestable after two years from the date the claim was certified for payment by the Secretary, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such institution, unless a demand for repurchase of the obligation shall have been made on behalf of the United States prior to the expiration of such two-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary is authorized and directed to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) For purposes of this section, the term “manufactured home” includes any elder cottage housing opportunity unit that is small, freestanding, barrier-free, energy efficient, removable, and designed to be installed adjacent to an existing 1- to 4-family dwelling.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Supplemental system; limitation on amount; termination of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To assist in providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, particularly in suburban and outlying areas, this section is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter by making feasible the insurance of mortgages covering properties in areas where it is not practicable to obtain conformity with many of the requirements essential to the insurance of mortgages on housing in built-up urban areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure, as hereinafter provided, any mortgage (as defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1707" title="12">section 1707 of this title</uscode>) offered to him which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000, except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased at any time or times by additional amounts aggregating not more than $150,000,000 upon a determination by the President, taking into account the general effect of any such increase upon conditions in the building industry and upon the national economy, that such increase is in the public interest: <em>And provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after August 2, 1954, except pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $5,700, and not to exceed 95 per centum of the appraised value, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, of a property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for a single-family residence, and which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagor shall be the owner and occupant of the property at the time of insurance and shall have paid on account of the property at least 5 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of acquisition in cash or its equivalent, or shall be the builder constructing the dwelling, in which case the principal obligation shall not exceed 85 per centum of the appraised value of the property or $5,100: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income particularly in suburban and outlying areas: <em>And provided further</em>, That, where the mortgagor is the owner and occupant of the property and establishes (to the satisfaction of the Secretary) that his home, which he occupied as an owner or as a tenant, was destroyed or damaged to such an extent that reconstruction is required as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm or other catastrophe, which the President, pursuant to <uscode detail="(2)" edition="2006" range="5122(2) and 5170" section="5122" title="42">sections 5122(2) and 5170 of title 42</uscode>, has determined to be a major disaster, such maximum dollar limitation may be increased by the Secretary from $5,700 to $7,000, and the percentage limitation may be increased by the Secretary from 95 per centum to 100 per centum of the appraised value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charges, if any) at not to exceed 5 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided and to the service charge, if any) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, service charges, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, and other matters as the the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section, but in the case of any mortgage, such charge shall not be less than an amount equiva<!-- PDFPage:521 -->lent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this section at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized, in his discretion, to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) notwithstanding subclauses (II) and (III), a mortgage for a property with an appraised value in excess of $50,000 that is located in an area of the State for which the average closing cost exceeds 2.10 percent of the average, for the State, of the sale price of properties located in the State for which mortgages have been <!-- PDFPage:528 -->executed, 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “area” means a metropolitan statistical area as established by the Office of Management and Budget; and the median 1-family house price for an area shall be equal to the median 1-family house price of the county within the area that has the highest such median price. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “average closing cost” means, with respect to a State, the average, for mortgages executed for properties that are located within the State, of the total amounts (as determined by the Secretary) of initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees (as the Secretary shall approve) that are paid in connection with such mortgages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case where the dwelling is not approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, such mortgage shall not exceed 90 per centum of the entire appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, unless (i) the dwelling was completed more than one year prior to the application for mortgage insurance, or (ii) the dwelling was approved for guaranty, insurance, or a direct loan under <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode> prior to the beginning of construction, or (iii) the dwelling is covered by a consumer protection or warranty plan acceptable to the Secretary and satisfies all requirements which would have been applicable if such dwelling had been approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. As used herein, the term “veteran” means any person who served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States for a period of not less than ninety days (or is certified by the Secretary of Defense as having performed extra-hazardous service), and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable, except that persons enlisting in the armed forces after September 7, 1980, or entering active duty after October 16, 1981, shall have their eligibility determined in accordance with <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2006" section="5303A" title="38">section 5303A(d) of title 38</uscode>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the residence due to the installation of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703(a) of this title</uscode>) therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the Secretary may not insure, or enter into a commitment to insure, a mortgage under this section that is executed by a first-time homebuyer and that involves a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in excess of 97 percent of the appraised value of the property unless the mortgagor has completed a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary; except that the Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, waive the applicability of this requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years (or thirty years if such mortgage is not approved for insurance prior to construction) from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default, reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid on account of the property (except with respect to a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who is a veteran) at least 3 per centum, or such larger amount as the Secretary may determine, of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of acquisition (excluding the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured) in cash or its equivalent: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who is sixty years of age or older as of the date the mortgage is endorsed for insurance or with respect to a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i) of this section, or with respect to a mortgage covering a single-family home being purchased under the low-income housing demonstration project assisted pursuant to section 1436 <sup><a href="#1709_1_target" name="1709_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, or with respect to a mortgage covering a housing unit in connection with a homeownership program under the Homeownership and Opportunity Through HOPE Act, the mortgagor's payment required by this subsection may be paid by a corporation or person other than the mortgagor under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe: <em>Provided further</em>, That for purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider as cash or its equivalent any amounts borrowed from a family member (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1707" title="12">section 1707 of this title</uscode>), subject only to the requirements that, in any case in which the repayment of such borrowed amounts is secured by a lien against the property, such lien shall be subordinate to the mortgage and the sum of the principal obligation of the mortgage and the obligation se<!-- PDFPage:529 -->cured by such lien may not exceed 100 percent of the appraised value of the property plus any initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees in connection with the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to fix premium charges for the insurance of mortgages under the separate sections of this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall be not less than an amount equivalent to one-fourth of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments: <em>Provided</em>, That premium charges fixed for insurance (1) under section 1715z–10, 1715z–12, 1715z–16, 1715z–17, or 1715z–18 of this title, or any other financing mechanism providing alternative methods for repayment of a mortgage that is determined by the Secretary to involve additional risk, or (2) under subsection (n) of this section are not required to be the same as the premium charges for mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, but in no case shall premium charges under subsection (n) of this section exceed 1 per centum per annum: <em>Provided</em>, That any reduced premium charge so fixed and computed may, in the discretion of the Secretary, also be made applicable in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe to each insured mortgage outstanding under the section or sections involved at the time the reduced premium charge is fixed. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures presented in payment of premium charges shall represent obligations of the particular insurance fund or account to which such premium charges are to be credited: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is economically sound. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this section until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages (1) for which the Secretary requires, at the time the mortgage is insured, the payment of a single premium charge to cover the total premium obligation for the insurance of the mortgage, and (2) on which the principal obligation is paid before the number of years on which the premium with respect to a particular mortgage was based, or the property is sold subject to the mortgage or is sold and the mortgage is assumed prior to such time, the Secretary shall provide for refunds, where appropriate, of a portion of the premium paid and shall provide for appropriate allocation of the premium cost among the mortgagors over the term of the mortgage, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary which take into account sound financial and actuarial considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, each mortgage secured by a 1- to 4-family dwelling that is an obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or of the General Insurance Fund pursuant to subsection (v) of this section and each mortgage that is insured under subsection (k) of this section or <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1715y" title="12">section 1715y(c) of this title</uscode>,,<sup><a href="#1709_2_target" name="1709_2">2</a></sup> shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall establish and collect, at the time of insurance, a single premium payment in an amount not exceeding 2.25 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage. In the case of a mortgage for which the mortgagor is a first-time homebuyer who completes a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary, the premium payment under this subparagraph shall not exceed 2.0 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorized claims procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, in accordance with this subsection and terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, pay insurance benefits to a mortgagee for any mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> through any of the following methods:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Assignment of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may pay insurance benefits whenever a mortgage has been in a monetary default for not less than 3 full monthly installments or whenever the mortgagee is entitled to foreclosure for a nonmonetary default. Insurance benefits shall be paid pursuant to this subparagraph only upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising out of the mortgage transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) title evidence satisfactory to the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such records relating to the mortgage transaction as the Secretary may require.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Conveyance of title to property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may pay insurance benefits if the mortgagee has acquired title to the mortgaged property through foreclosure or has otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after a default upon—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the standards of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner provided by such standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the assignment to the Secretary of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may permit the mortgagee to tender to the Secretary a satisfactory conveyance of title and transfer of possession directly from the mortgagor or other appropriate grantor, and may pay to the mortgagee the insurance benefits to which it would otherwise be entitled if such conveyance had been made to the mortgagee and from the mortgagee to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Claim without conveyance of title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may pay insurance benefits upon sale of the mortgaged property at foreclosure where such sale is for at least the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary, and upon assignment to the Secretary of all claims referred to in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Preforeclosure sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may pay insurance benefits upon the sale of the mortgaged property by the mortgagor after default and the assignment to the Secretary of all claims referred to in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sale of the mortgaged property has been approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the mortgagee receives an amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the mortgagor has received an appropriate disclosure, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment for loss mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may pay insurance benefits to the mortgagee to recompense the mortgagee for all or part of any costs of the mortgagee for taking loss mitigation actions that provide an alternative to foreclosure of a mortgage that is in default (including but not limited to actions such as special forbearance, loan modification, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, but not including assignment of mortgages to the Secretary under paragraph (1)(A)). No actions taken under this paragraph, nor any failure to act under this paragraph, by the Secretary or by a mortgagee shall be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of claims procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish guidelines for determining which of the procedures for payment of insurance under paragraph (1) are available to a mortgagee when it claims insurance benefits. At least one of the procedures for payment of insurance benefits specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) shall be available to a mortgagee with respect to a mortgage, but the same procedure shall not be required to be available for all of the mortgages held by a mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Servicing of assigned mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a mortgage is assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may permit the assigning mortgagee or its servicer to continue to service the mortgage for reasonable compensation and on terms and conditions determined by the Secretary. Neither the Secretary nor any servicer of the mortgage shall be required to forbear from collection of amounts due under the mortgage or otherwise pursue loss mitigation measures.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Calculation of insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance benefits shall be paid in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="1735d" title="12">section 1735d of this title</uscode> and shall be equal to the original principal obligation of the mortgage (with such additions and deduc<!-- PDFPage:548 -->tions as the Secretary determines are appropriate) which was unpaid upon the date of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the institution of foreclosure proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) sale of the mortgaged property by the mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Forbearance and recasting after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The mortgagee may, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) extend the time for the curing of the default and the time for commencing foreclosure proceedings or for otherwise acquiring title to the mortgaged property, to such time as the mortgagee determines is necessary and desirable to enable the mortgagor to complete the mortgage payments, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity of the mortgage, and in the event of a subsequent foreclosure or acquisition of the property by other means the Secretary may include in the amount of insurance benefits an amount equal to any unpaid mortgage interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide for a modification of the terms of the mortgage for the purpose of recasting, over the remaining term of the mortgage or over such longer period pursuant to guidelines as may be prescribed by the Secretary, the total unpaid amount then due, with the modification to become effective currently or to become effective upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default; and the principal amount of the mortgage, as modified, shall be considered the “original principal obligation of the mortgage” for purposes of paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Termination of premium obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease upon fulfillment of the appropriate requirements under which the Secretary may pay insurance benefits, as described in paragraph (1). The Secretary may also terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay mortgage insurance premiums upon receipt of an application filed by the mortgagee for insurance benefits under paragraph (1), or in the event the contract of insurance is terminated pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1715t" title="12">section 1715t of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Effect on payment of insurance benefits under section 1715u</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Secretary to pay insurance benefits under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715u" title="12">section 1715u of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Treatment of mortgage assignment program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or the Amended Stipulation entered as a consent decree on November 8, 1979, in Ferrell v. Cuomo, No. 73 C 334 (N.D. Ill.), or any other order intended to require the Secretary to operate the program of mortgage assignment and forbearance that was operated by the Secretary pursuant to the Amended Stipulation and under the authority of <uscode edition="2006" section="1715u" title="12">section 1715u of this title</uscode>, prior to its amendment by section 407(b) of The Balanced Budget Downpayment Act, I (<plaw congress="104" isprivate="false" number="99">Public Law 104–99</plaw>; <statuteatlarge page="45" volume="110">110 Stat. 45</statuteatlarge>), no mortgage assigned under this section may be included in any mortgage foreclosure avoidance program that is the same or substantially equivalent to such a program of mortgage assignment and forbearance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagor or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be in such form and amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be subject to such terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; issuance; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debentures issued under this section to any mortagee <sup><a href="#1710_1_target" name="1710_1">1</a></sup> with respect to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> shall be issued in the name of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund as obligor and shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages insured under section 1709 or <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> prior to February 3, 1938 shall be subject only to such Federal, State, and local taxes as the mortgages in exchange for which they are issued would be subject to in the hands of the holder of the debentures and shall be a liability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, but such debentures shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; but any mortgagee entitled to receive any such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof a cash adjustment and de<!-- PDFPage:549 -->bentures issued as hereinafter provided and bearing the current rate of interest. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by the mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; and such debentures shall be paid out of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate of claim shall not be issued and the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be applicable in the case of a mortgage accepted for insurance pursuant to a commitment issued on or after September 2, 1964.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Division of excess proceeds; settlement of certificates of claims and refunds to mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, after deducting (in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound accounting practice) the expenses incurred by the Secretary, the net amount realized from any property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and the claims assigned therewith exceed the face value of the debentures issued and the cash paid in exchange for such property plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property if the mortgage was insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That on and after September 2, 1964, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments for insurance issued after August 11, 1955, and, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments issued prior to such date, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds to mortgagors at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: <em>Provided</em>, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificates of claim outstanding as of September 2, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With the consent of the holder thereof, the Secretary is authorized, without awaiting the final liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, to settle any certificate of claim issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, with respect to which settlement had not been effected prior to September 2, 1964, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after September 2, 1964, in the liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this section; <!-- PDFPage:550 -->and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this section: <em>Provided</em>, That <uscode edition="2006" section="5" title="41">section 5 of title 41</uscode> shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The Secretary shall, by regulation, carry out a program of sales of such properties and shall develop and implement appropriate credit terms and standards to be used in carrying out the program. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint: <em>And provided further</em>, That a conveyance or transfer of title to real or personal property or an interest therein to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, his successors and assigns, without identifying the Secretary therein, shall be deemed a proper conveyance or transfer to the same extent and of like effect as if the Secretary were personally named in such conveyance or transfer. The Secretary may sell real and personal property acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Disposition of assets in revitalization areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this subsection is to require the Secretary to carry out a program under which eligible assets (as such term is defined in paragraph (2)) shall be made available for sale in a manner that promotes the revitalization, through expanded homeownership opportunities, of revitalization areas. Notwithstanding the authority under the last sentence of subsection (g) of this section, the Secretary shall dispose of all eligible assets under the program and shall establish the program in accordance with the requirements under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term “eligible asset” means any of the following categories of assets of the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines at any time that the asset property is economically or otherwise infeasible to rehabilitate or that the best use of the asset property is as open space (including park land):</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any property that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is designed as a dwelling for occupancy by 1 to 4 families;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) was previously subject to a mortgage insured under the provisions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) is owned by the Secretary pursuant to the payment of insurance benefits under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any mortgage that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is an interest in a property that meets the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was previously insured under the provisions of this chapter except for mortgages insured under or made pursuant to sections 1715z, 1715z–12, or 1715z–20 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is held by the Secretary pursuant to the payment of insurance benefits under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subsection, an asset under this subparagraph shall be considered to be located in a revitalization area, or in the asset control area of a preferred purchaser, if the property described in clause (i) is located in such area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Revitalization areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall designate areas as revitalization areas for purposes of this subsection. Before designation of an area as a revitalization area, the Secretary shall consult with affected units of general local government, States, and Indian tribes and interested nonprofit organizations. The Secretary may designate as revitalization areas only areas that meet one of the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Very-low income area</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of any area located within a metropolitan area, such metropolitan area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of any area not located within a metropolitan area, the State in which the area is located.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) High concentration of eligible assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A high rate of default or foreclosure for single family mortgages insured under this chapter has resulted, or may result, in the area—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) having a disproportionately high concentration of eligible assets, in comparison with the concentration of such assets in surrounding areas; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) being detrimentally impacted by eligible assets in the vicinity of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Low home ownership rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The rate for home ownership of single family homes in the area is substantially below the rate for homeownership in the metropolitan area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Preference for sale to preferred purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide a preference, among prospective purchasers of eligible assets, for sale of such assets to any purchaser who—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:551 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is—</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Adjustment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, pursuant to the independent annual actuarial study of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund required under subsection (g) of this section, the Secretary determines that the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund is not meeting the operational goals under paragraph (2), the Secretary may not issue distributions, and may, by regulation, propose and implement any adjustments to the insurance premiums under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(c) of this title</uscode> or section 2103(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “mortgagee” means the original lender under a mortgage, and its successors and assigns, and includes the holders of credit instruments issued under a trust mortgage or deed of trust pursuant to which such holders act by and through a trustee therein named.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term “mortgagor” means the original borrower under a mortgage and its successors and assigns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term “maturity date” means the date on which the mortgage indebtedness would be extinguished if paid in accordance with the periodic payments provided for in the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term “slum or blighted area” means any area where dwellings predominate which, by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or design, lack of ventilation, light or sanitation facilities, or any combination of these factors, are detrimental to safety, health, or morals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term “rental housing” means housing, the occupancy of which is permitted by the owner thereof in consideration of the payment of agreed charges, whether or not, by the terms of the agreement, such payment over a period of time will entitle the occupant to the ownership of the premises or space in a manufactured home court or park properly arranged and equipped to accommodate manufactured homes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term “State” includes the several States, and Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of additional mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode>, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in this section (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal or State instrumentalities, municipal corporate instrumentalities of one or more States, or limited dividend or redevelopment or housing corporations restricted by Federal or State laws or regulations of State banking or insurance departments as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, or methods of operation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation so as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. Any such regulations or restrictions shall continue for such period or periods as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may require, including until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder, or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire, for not to exceed $100, such stock or interest in the mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulations or restrictions. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance of mortgages under this section is intended to facilitate particularly the production of rental accommodations, at reasonable rents, of design and size suitable for family living. The Secretary is, therefore, authorized in the administration of this section to take action, by regulation or otherwise, which will direct the benefits of mortgage insurance hereunder primarily to those projects which make adequate provision for families with children, and in which every effort has been made to achieve moderate rental charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary may not insure any mortgage under this section (except a mortgage with <!-- PDFPage:561 -->respect to a manufactured home park designed exclusively for occupancy by elderly persons) unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. <plaw congress="93" isprivate="false" number="383">Pub. L. 93–383,</plaw> title III, §304(a)(1), Aug. 22, 1974, <statuteatlarge page="677" volume="88">88 Stat. 677</statuteatlarge>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project (when the proposed improvements are completed): <em>Provided</em>, That this limitation shall not apply to mortgages on housing in Alaska or in Guam, but such a mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the value of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the land, the proposed physical improvements, utilities within the boundaries of the property or project, architect's fees, taxes, and interest accruing during construction, and other miscellaneous charges incident to construction and approved by the Secretary): <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this section shall preclude the insurance of mortgages covering existing construction located in slum or blighted areas, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, and the Secretary may require such repair or rehabilitation work to be completed as is, in his discretion, necessary to remove conditions detrimental to safety, health, or morals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Not to exceed, for such part of the property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $38,025 per family unit without a bedroom, $42,120 per family unit with one bedroom, $50,310 per family unit with two bedrooms, $62,010 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $70,200 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, or not to exceed $17,460 per space; except that as to projects to consist of elevator type structures the Secretary may in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $43,875 per family unit without a bedroom, $49,140 per family unit with one bedroom, $60,255 per family unit with two bedrooms, $75,465 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $85,328 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to compensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the dollar amount limitations in subparagraph (A) (as such limitations may have been adjusted in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="1712a" title="12">section 1712a of this title</uscode>) by not to exceed 140 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 140 percent, or 170 percent in high cost areas, where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720 <sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703(a) of this title</uscode>) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42) <sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments (unless otherwise approved by the Secretary) within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. No mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section or section 1715a <sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title unless the Secretary finds that the property or project, with respect to which the mortgage is executed, is economically sound. Such property or project may include five or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Premium, appraisal, and inspection charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall collect a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section which shall be payable annually in advance by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under any subchapter and section of this chapter, except debentures of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, or of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest. In addition to the premium charge herein provided for the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the appraisal of a property or project offered for insurance and for the inspection of such property or project during construction: <em>Provided</em>, That such charges for appraisal and in<!-- PDFPage:562 -->spection shall not aggregate more than 1 per centum of the original principal face amount of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjusted premium charge on payment of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. <plaw congress="89" isprivate="false" number="117">Pub. L. 89–117,</plaw> title XI, §1108(e)(3), Aug. 10, 1965, <statuteatlarge page="504" volume="79">79 Stat. 504</statuteatlarge></h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of insurance after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loans not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transactions. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (h) of this section, and debentures having a par value equal to the original principal face amount of the mortgage plus such amount as the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default, less the sum of (i) that part of the amount of the principal obligation that has been repaid by the mortgagor, (ii) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation, and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by, the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (ii) hereof, shall not apply. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon receipt, after September 2, 1964, of an application for insurance benefits on a mortgage insured under this chapter, the Secretary may terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay premium charges on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued under this section shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of the assignment, transfer and delivery to the Secretary provided for in subsection (g) of this section, the mortgagor had extinguished the mortgage indebtedness by payment in full of all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. If the net amount realized from the mortgage, and all claims in connection therewith, so assigned, transferred, and delivered, and from the property covered by such mortgage and all claims in connection with such property, after deducting all expenses incurred by the Secretary in handling, dealing with, acquiring title to, and disposing of such mortgage and property and in collecting such claims, exceeds the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:563 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations, and shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (g) of this section, except that debentures issued pursuant to the provisions of section 1715k(f), section 1715<em>l</em>(g), and <uscode edition="2006" section="1715x" title="12">section 1715x of this title</uscode> may be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned (or the property is conveyed) to the Secretary and shall bear interest from such date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Debentures; form and amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be in such form and amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be subject to such terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Acquisition of property by conveyance or foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized either to (1) acquire possession of and title to any property, covered by a mortgage insured under this section and assigned to him, by voluntary conveyance in extinguishment of the mortgage indebtedness, or (2) institute proceedings for foreclosure on the property covered by any such insured mortgage and prosecute such proceedings to conclusion. The Secretary at any sale under foreclosure may, in his discretion, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, bid any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by the mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses, and may become the purchaser of the property at such sale. In determining the amount to be bid, the Secretary shall act consistently with the goal established in section 1701z–11(a)(1) of this title. The Secretary is authorized to pay from the General Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to defray such taxes, insurance, costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with the acquisition or foreclosure of property under this section.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that, because of higher costs prevailing in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands, it is not feasible to construct dwellings or manufactured home courts or parks on property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, within the limitations as to maximum or maxima mortgage amounts provided in this chapter, the Secretary may, by regulations or otherwise, prescribe, with respect to dollar amount, a higher maximum or maxima for the principal obligation of mortgages insured under this chapter covering property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands in such amounts as he shall find necessary to compensate for such higher costs but not to exceed, in any event, the maximum or maxima otherwise applicable (including increased mortgage amounts in geographical areas where cost levels so require) by more than one-half thereof. No mortgage with respect to a project or property in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands shall be accepted for insurance under this chapter unless the Secretary finds that the project or property is an acceptable risk giving consideration to the acute housing shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands: <em>Provided</em>, That any such mortgage may be insured or accepted for insurance without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the Secretary find the project or property to be economically sound or an acceptable risk. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any other law, the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof shall be eligible as mortgagor or mortgagee, as the case may be, for any of the purposes of mortgage insurance under the provisions of this chapter. Upon application by the mortgagee (1) where the mortgagor is regulated or restricted pursuant to the last sentence of this section or (2) where the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof is the mortgagor or mortgagee, for the insurance of a mortgage under any provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure the mortgage (including advances thereon where otherwise authorized), and to make commitments for the insuring of any such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, under such provision (and this section) without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor shall have paid a prescribed amount on account of such property. Without limiting the authority of the Secretary under any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgagor in such case (except where the Alaska Housing Authority is the mortgagor or mortgagee), to require the mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods or operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Secretary determines advisable to provide reasonable rentals and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment.</p>

Premium charges on the insurance of mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund may be payable in debentures which are the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund.</p>

Under such plan, each family unit shall be eligible for individual ownership and provision shall be included for the sale of the family units, together with an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, to low or moderate income purchasers. The Secretary shall obtain such agreements as he determines to be necessary to assure continued maintenance of the common areas and facilities. Upon such sale, the family unit and the undivided interest in the common areas shall be released from the lien of the project mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this subsection mortgages financing the purchase of individual family units under the plan prescribed in paragraph (1). Commitments may be issued by the Secretary for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for such insurance, the mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be executed by a mortgagor having an income within the limits prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of projects financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) of this section which bears interest at the below-market rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees, as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed the Secretary's estimate of the appraised value of the family unit, including the mortgagor's interest in the common areas and facilities, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary (which may vary in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary promulgated pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph (4) of this subsection) but not less than the below-market rate in effect under the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section at the date of the commitment for insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary may prescribe, but not to exceed forty years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The price for which the individual family unit is sold to the low or moderate income purchaser shall not exceed the appraised value of the property, as determined under subparagraph (A)(ii), except that the purchaser shall be required to pay on account of the property at the time of purchase at least such amount, in cash or its equivalent (which shall be not less than 3 per centum of such price, but which may be applied in whole or in part toward closing costs), as the Secretary may determine to be reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the sale of all of the family units covered by the project mortgage, and the release of all of the family units (including the undivided interest allocable to each unit in the common areas and facilities) from the lien of the project mortgage, the insurance of the project mortgage shall be terminated and no adjusted premium charge shall be collected by the Secretary upon such termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any mortgage covering an individual family unit insured under this subsection shall contain a provision that, if the original mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property, the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time the commitment was issued for the insurance of the project mortgage; except that the requirement for an increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) a nonprofit purchaser approved by the Secretary, or (ii) a low or moderate income purchaser who has an income within the limits prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of projects financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) of this section which bears interest at the below-market rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section. The mortgage shall also contain a provision that, if the Secretary determines that the annual income of the original mortgagor (or a purchaser described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) has increased to an amount enabling payment of a greater rate of interest, the interest rate of the individual mortgage may be increased up to the highest rate permissible under the regulations of the Secretary for mortgages insured under this section, effective at the time the commitment was issued for the insurance of the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715</uscode><em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715z–1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1437f</uscode>] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1485" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1485</uscode>] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.—It is the purpose of this title—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1715m. Mortgage insurance for servicemen</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; housing certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to aid in the provision of housing accommodations for servicemen in the armed forces of the United States and their families, servicemen in the United States Coast Guard and their families, and servicemen in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their families by supplementing the insurance of mortgages under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> with a system of mortgage insurance specially designed to assist the financing required for the construction or purchase of dwellings by those persons. As used in this section, a “serviceman” means a person to whom the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee designated by him), the Secretary of Homeland Security (or any officer or employee designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee designated by him), as the case may be, has issued a certificate hereunder indicating that such person requires housing, is serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, in the United States Coast Guard, or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has served on active duty for more than two years, but a certificate shall not be issued hereunder to any person ordered to active duty for training purposes only. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Commerce, respectively, are authorized to prescribe rules and regulations governing the issuance of such certificates and may withhold issuance of more than one such certificate to a serviceman whenever in his discretion issuance is not justified due to circumstances resulting from military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of mortgage for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:612 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) meet the requirements of section 1709(b), 1709(i), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2), or 1715y(c) of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a dwelling designed principally for a one-family residence or a one-family unit in a condominium project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a principal obligation not in excess of the sum of (i) 97 per centum of $25,000 of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, and (ii) 95 per centum of such value in excess of $25,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) be executed by a mortgagor who at the time of application for insurance is certified as a “serviceman” and who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property as a principal residence or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of his military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of acceptance; payment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe the manner in which a mortgage may be accepted for insurance under this section. Premiums fixed by the Secretary under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> with respect to, or payable during, the period of ownership by a serviceman of the property involved shall not be payable by the mortgage <sup><a href="#1715m_1_target" name="1715m_1">1</a></sup> but shall be paid not less frequently than once each year, upon request of the Secretary to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may be, from the respective appropriations available for pay and allowances of persons eligible for mortgage insurance under this section. As used herein, “the period of ownership by a serviceman” means the period, for which premiums are fixed, prior to the date that the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), the Secretary of Homeland Security (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), as the case may be, furnishes the Secretary with a certification that such ownership (as defined by the Secretary), has terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Entitlement of mortgagee to benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee under a mortgage insured under this section is entitled to the benefits of the insurance as provided in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(a) of this title</uscode> with respect to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),<sup><a href="#1715m_2_target" name="1715m_2">2</a></sup> (j), and (k) <sup><a href="#1715m_2_target" name="1715m_2">2</a></sup> of <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> shall apply to mortgages insured under this section, except that as applied to those mortgages (1) all references to the Fund, or Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, shall refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (2) all references to <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> shall refer to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of insurance on mortgages covering single-family dwellings or one-family units in condominium projects if mortgage is assumed by serviceman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to transfer to this section the insurance on any mortgage covering a single-family dwelling or a one-family unit in a condominium project insured under this chapter, if the mortgage indebtedness thereof has been assumed by a serviceman who at the time of assumption is the owner of the property and either occupies the property as a principal residence or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of his military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Extension of period of ownership where serviceman dies while on active duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a serviceman dies while on active duty in the armed forces of the United States or in the United States Coast Guard or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving a surviving widow as owner of the property, the period of ownership by the serviceman (within the meaning of subsection (c) of this section) shall extend for two years beyond the date of the serviceman's death or until the date the widow disposes of the property, whichever date occurs first. The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may be, shall notify such widow promptly following the serviceman's death of the additional costs to be borne by the mortgagor following termination of the two-year period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of mortgages given to refinance mortgages covering existing property or projects in urban renewal areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this subchapter and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in section 1715<em>l</em> of this <!-- PDFPage:615 -->title, the Secretary may in his discretion insure under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title any mortgage executed by a mortgagor of the character described therein where such mortgage is given to refinance a mortgage covering an existing property or project (other than a one- to four-family structure) located in an urban renewal area, if the Secretary finds that such insurance will facilitate the occupancy of dwelling units in the property or project by families of low or moderate income or families displaced from an urban renewal area or displaced as a result of governmental action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance of certain assigned mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have authority to insure under this chapter any mortgage assigned to the Secretary in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance or executed in connection with the sale by the Secretary, including a sale through another entity acting under authority of the fourth sentence of <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(g) of this title</uscode>, of any property acquired under any section or subchapter of this chapter without regard to any limitations or requirements contained in this chapter upon the eligibility of the mortgage, upon the payment of insurance premiums, or upon the terms and conditions of insurance settlement and the benefits of the insurance to be included in such settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary's discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term “operating loss” means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the operating loss shall have occurred during the first 24 months after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding the operating loss.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling; and (iii) shall not cover a subsidized project, as defined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the unreimbursed cash contributions made on or after March 18, 1987, by the project owner for the use of the project, during any period of consecutive months (not exceeding 24 months) in the first 10 years after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary, except that in no event may the amount of the loan exceed the operating loss during such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage. The Secretary may provide insurance pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), or pursuant to both such paragraphs, in connection with an existing project mortgage, except that the Secretary may not provide insurance pursuant to both such paragraphs in connection with the same period of months referred to in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B). The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in any amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715<em>o</em> of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z–1 of this title or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this sub<!-- PDFPage:616 -->section, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before October 28, 1992, and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property in older, declining urban areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except <uscode edition="2006" section="1715c" title="12">section 1715c of this title</uscode>, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B of this chapter, other than the limitation in <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(g) of this title</uscode>, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B of this chapter a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing project; refinancing of existing debt of existing hospital, or purchase or refinancing of rental rehabilitated property; terms and conditions, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to insure under any section of this subchapter a mortgage executed in connection with the purchase of refinancing of an existing multifamily housing project or the purchase or refinancing of existing debt of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the purchase or refinancing under this subsection of a multifamily housing project located in an older, declining urban area, the Secretary shall make available an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 of available purchase authority pursuant to section 1720 <sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of this title to reduce interest rates on low- and moderate-income rental housing in projects having 100 units or less which otherwise could not support refinancing and moderate rehabilitation without causing excessive rent burdens on current tenants due to rent increases. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as he deems necessary to assure that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is used to lower the monthly debt service only to the extent necessary to assure the continued economic viability of the project, taking into account any rent reductions to be implemented by the mortgagor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during the mortgage term no rental increases shall be made except those which are necessary to offset actual and reasonable operating expense increases or other necessary expense increases and maintain reasonable profit levels approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For all insurance authorized by this subsection and provided pursuant to a commitment entered into after October 8, 1980, the Secretary may not accept an offer to prepay or request refinancing of a mortgage secured by rental housing unless the Secretary takes appropriate action that will obligate the borrower (and successors in interest thereof) to utilize the property as a rental property for a period of five years from the date on which the insurance was provided (twenty years in the case of any such mortgage purchased under section 1720 <sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of this title) unless the Secretary finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the conversion of the property to a cooperative, or condominium form of ownership is sponsored by a bona fide tenants’ organization representing a majority of the households in the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) continuance of the property as rental housing is clearly unnecessary to assure adequate rental housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income people in the community; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) continuance of the property as rental housing would have an undesirable and deleterious effect on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of refinancing of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) the Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is employed to lower the monthly debt service costs (taking into account any fees or charges connected with such refinancing) of such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the proceeds of any refinancing will be employed only to retire the existing indebtedness and pay the necessary cost of refinancing on such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<!-- PDFPage:617 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) is economically viable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the applicable requirements for certificates, studies, and statements of <uscode edition="2006" section="1715w" title="12">section 1715w of this title</uscode> (for the existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or any combination thereof, proposed to be refinanced) or of section 1715z–7 of this title (for the existing hospital proposed to be refinanced) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any purchase or refinancing under this subsection involving property to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437<em>o</em> <sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, the Secretary may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include rehabilitation or development costs of not to exceed $20,000 per unit, except that the Secretary may increase such amount by not to exceed 25 per centum for specific properties where cost levels so require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) permit subordinated liens securing up to the full amount of mortgage financing provided by State or local governments or agencies thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pay such benefits in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insurance of mortgages covering multifamily housing projects including units not self-contained</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no mortgage covering new or rehabilitated multifamily housing or a property or project described in subchapter IX–B of this chapter shall be insured under this chapter unless the mortgagor has agreed (a) to certify, upon completion of the physical improvements on the mortgaged property or project and prior to final endorsement of the mortgage, either (i) that the approved percentage of actual cost (as those terms are herein defined) equaled or exceeded the proceeds of the mortgage loan or (ii) the amount by which the proceeds of the mortgage loan exceeded such approved percentage of actual cost, as the case may be, and (b) to pay forthwith to the mortgagee, for application to the reduction of the principal obligation of such mortgage, the amount, if any, certified to be in excess of such approved percentage of actual cost. Upon the Secretary's approval of the mortgagor's certification as required hereunder, such certification shall be final and incontestable, except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the mortgagor. As used in this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The term “new or rehabilitated multifamily housing” means a project or property approved for mortgage insurance prior to the construction or the repair and rehabilitation involved and covered by a mortgage insured or to be insured (i) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode>, (ii) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> with respect to any property or project of a corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> or with respect to any property or project of a mortgagor of the character described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) thereof, (iii) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715k" title="12">section 1715k of this title</uscode> if the mortgage meets the requirements of paragraph (3)(B) of subsection (d) thereof, (iv) under section 1715<em>l</em> of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) of subsection (d) thereof, (v) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715v" title="12">section 1715v of this title</uscode>, (vi) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715x" title="12">section 1715x of this title</uscode> if the mortgage meets the requirements of subsection (b), (vii) under section 1748h–2 of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of subsection (f), (viii) under <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2006" section="1715y" title="12">section 1715y(d) of this title</uscode>, or (ix) under section 1715z–1 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term “approved percentage” means the percentage figure which, under applicable provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to apply to his estimate of value, cost, or replacement costs, as the case may be, of the property or project in determining the maximum insurable mortgage amount; except that if the mortgage is to assist the financing of repair or rehabilitation and no part of the proceeds will be used to finance the purchase of the land or structure involved, the approved percentage shall be 100 per centum; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term “actual cost” has the following meaning: (i) in case the mortgage is to assist the financing of new construction, the term means the actual cost to the mortgagor of such construction, including amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organizational and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus (1) a reasonable allowance for builder's profit if the mortgagor is also the builder as defined by the Secretary, and (2) an amount equal to the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of any land (prior to the construction of the improvements built as a part of the project) in the property or project owned by the mortgagor in fee (or, in case the land in the property or project is held by the mortgagor under a leasehold or other interest less than a fee, such amount as the mortgagor paid for the acquisition of such leasehold or other interest but, in no event, in excess of the fair market value of such leasehold or other interest exclusive of the proposed improvements), but excluding the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the construction of the improvements, or (ii) in case the mortgage is to assist the financing of repair or rehabilitation the terms means the actual cost to the mortgagor of such repair or rehabilitation, including the amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organization and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus (1) a reasonable allowance for builder's profit if the mortgagor is also the builder as defined by the Secretary, and (2) an additional amount equal to (A) in case the land and improvements are to be acquired by the mortgagor and the purchase price thereof is to be financed with part of the proceeds of the mortgage, the purchase price of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation, or (B) in case the land and improvements are owned by the mortgagor subject to an outstanding indebtedness to be refinanced with part of the proceeds <!-- PDFPage:623 -->of the mortgage, the amount of such outstanding indebtedness secured by such land and improvements, but excluding (for the purposes of this clause (ii)) the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the construction of the improvements: <em>Provided</em>, That such additional amount under (A) of this clause (ii) shall in no event exceed the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation, and such additional amount under (B) of this clause (ii) shall in no event exceed the approved percentage of the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation. In the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(4), 1715v, 1715x, or 1715z–1 of this title where the mortgagor is also the builder as defined by the Secretary, there shall be included in the actual cost, in lieu of the allowance for builder's profit under clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence, an allowance for builder's and sponsor's profit and risk of 10 per centum (unless the Secretary, after finding that such allowance is unreasonable, shall by regulation prescribe a lesser percentage) of all other items entering into the term “actual cost” except land or amounts paid for a leasehold and amounts included under either (A) or (B) of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. In the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(4), 1715v, 1715x, or 1715z–1 of this title, where the mortgagor is not also the builder as defined by the Secretary, there shall be included in the actual cost an allowance for sponsor's profit and risk of the said 10 per centum or lesser percentage of all other items entering into the term “actual cost” except land or amounts paid for a leasehold, amounts included under either (A) or (B) of the said clause (ii), and amounts paid by the mortgagor under a general construction contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgage shall be executed by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may in his discretion require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to charges and methods of financing, and, in addition thereto, if the mortgagor is a corporate entity, as to capital structure and rate of return. As an aid to the regulation or restriction of any mortgagor with respect to any of the foregoing matters, the Secretary may <!-- PDFPage:630 -->make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary. Any stock or interest so purchased shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project, or 95 percent of the estimated value of the property or project in the case of a mortgagor that is a private nonprofit corporation or association (under the meaning given such term for purposes of section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title), including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) equipment to be used in the operation of the home or facility or combined home and facility when the proposed improvements are completed and the equipment is installed; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) With respect to nursing homes and intermediate care facilities and combined nursing home and intermediate care facilities, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless he has received, from the State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521 <sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="291d" title="42">42 U.S.C. 291d </uscode>(a)(1), 300m] for the State in which is located the nursing home or intermediate care facility or combined nursing home and intermediate care facility covered by the mortgage, a certification that (i) there is a need for such home or facility or combined home and facility, and (ii) there are in force in such State or in the municipality or other political subdivision of the State in which the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility is to be located reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation governing it. No such mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary has received such assurance as he may deem satisfactory from the State agency that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to any home or facility or combined home and facility located in the State for which mortgage insurance is provided under this section. If no such State agency exists, or if the State agency exists but is not empowered to provide a certification that there is a need for the home or facility or combined home and facility as required in clause (i) of the first sentence, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless (i) the State in which the home or facility or combined home and facility is located has conducted or commissioned and paid for the preparation of an independent study of market need and feasibility that (I) is prepared in accordance with the principles established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; (II) assesses, on a marketwide basis, the impact of the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility on, and its relationship to, other health care facilities and services, the percentage of excess beds, demographic projections, alternative health care delivery systems, and the reimbursement structure of the home, facility, or combined home and facility; (III) is addressed to and is acceptable to the Secretary in form and substance; and (IV) in the event the State does not prepare the study, is prepared by a financial consultant who is selected by the State or the applicant for mortgage insurance and is approved by the Secretary; and (ii) the State complies with the other provisions of this subparagraph that would otherwise be required to be met by a State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521 <sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary determines that the level of financing acquired by the mortgagor and any other resources available for the facility will be sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision of supportive services in accordance with subsection (b)(6) of this section;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist in lowering housing costs and improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability or neighborhood design through the utilization of advanced housing technology, or experimental property standards, the Secretary is authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including home improvement loans, and including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties including dwellings involving the utilization and testing of advanced technology in housing design, materials, or construction, or experimental property standards for neighborhood design if the Secretary determines that (A) the property is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for testing advanced housing technology or experimental property standards, (B) the utilization and testing of the advanced technology or experimental property standards involved will provide data or experience which the Secretary deems to be significant in reducing housing costs or improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability, or improving neighborhood design, and (C) the mortgages are eligible for insurance under the provisions of this section and under any further terms and conditions which may be prescribed by the Secretary to establish the acceptability of the mortgages for insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is further authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties in projects to be carried out in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary under <uscode edition="2006" section="1701z" title="12">section 1701z of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of one of the other sections or subchapters of this chapter; except that, in lieu of determining the appraised value or the replacement cost of the property in cases involving new construction or the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation of improvement in cases involving existing properties, the Secretary shall estimate the cost of replacing the property using comparable conventional design, materials, and construction, and any limitation upon the maximum mortgage amount available to a nonoccupant owner shall not, in the discretion of the Secretary, be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:634 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with mortgagor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into such contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with the mortgagor and others as he deems necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this section, and may expend available funds for such purposes, including the correction (when he determines it necessary to protect the occupants), at any time subsequent to insurance of a mortgage, of defects or failures in the dwellings which the Secretary finds are caused by or related to the advanced housing technology utilized in their design or construction or experimental property standards. Any authority which the Secretary may exercise in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, insured under any other section of this subchapter (including payments to reduce rentals for, or to facilitate homeownership by, lower income families) may be exercised in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, meeting the requirements of such other section (except as specified in subsection (b) of this section), which is insured under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if the mortgage insured under this section was insured under such other section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigations and analysis of data; publication and distribution of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make such investigations and analyses of data, and publish and distribute such reports, as he determines to be necessary or desirable to assure the most beneficial use of the data and information to be acquired as a result of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entitlement to insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee or lender under a mortgage insured under subsection (b) of this section shall be entitled to insurance benefits determined in the same manner as such benefits would be determined if such mortgage or loan were insured under the section or subchapter of this chapter for which it otherwise would have been eligible except for the experimental feature of the property involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Defaults; payment in cash or debentures; acquisition of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, in the case of default on any mortgage insured under this section, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such subsections in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire the mortgage loan and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide an additional means of increasing the supply of privately owned dwelling units where, under the laws of the State in which the property is located, real property title and ownership are established with respect to a one-family unit which is part of a multifamily project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The terms “mortgage”, “mortgagee”, “mortgagor”, “maturity date”, and “State” shall have the meanings respectively set forth in <uscode edition="2006" section="1707" title="12">section 1707 of this title</uscode>, except that the term “mortgage” for the purposes of subsection (c) this section may include a first mortgage given to secure the unpaid purchase price of a fee interest in, or a long-term leasehold interest in, a one-family unit in a multifamily project, including a project in which the dwelling units are attached, semi-attached, or detached, and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project where the mortgage is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for insurance under this section. The term “common areas and facilities” as used in this section shall be deemed to include the land and such commercial, community, and other facilities as are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization; eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe (including the minimum number of family units in the project which shall be offered for sale and provisions for the protection of the consumer and the public interest), to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, if (1) the mortgage meets the requirements of this subsection and of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b) of this title</uscode>, except as that section is modified by this subsection, and (2) at least 80 percent of the units in the project covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter are occupied by the mortgagors or comortgagors. Any project proposed to be constructed or rehabilitated after June 30, 1961, with the assistance of mortgage insurance under this chapter, where the sale of family units is to be assisted with mortgage insurance under this subsection, shall be subject to such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this subsection, a mortgage shall (A) involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed the maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)(2)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b)(2) of this title</uscode> or pursuant to <uscode detail="(h)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(h) of this title</uscode> under the conditions described in <uscode detail="(h)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(h) of this title</uscode>, and (B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage. The mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary determines to be necessary for the maintenance of common areas and facilities and the multifamily project. The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Blanket mortgages of multifamily projects; plan of family unit ownership; regulations; stock purchase and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to individual mortgages insured under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure blanket mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover multifamily projects to be constructed or rehabilitated in cases where the mortgage is held by a mortgagor, approved by the Secretary, which—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:636 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has certified to the Secretary, as a condition of obtaining the insurance of a blanket mortgage under this subsection, that upon completion of the multifamily project covered by such mortgage it intends to commit the ownership of the multifamily project to a plan of family unit ownership under which each family unit would be eligible for individual mortgage insurance under subsection (c) of this section and will faithfully and diligently make and carry out all reasonable efforts to establish such plan of family unit ownership and to sell such family units to purchasers approved by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may, in the Secretary's discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par at any time upon the request of the Secretary after the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility for insurance of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance, a blanket mortgage on any multifamily project of a mortgagor of the character described in subsection (d) of this section shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. <plaw congress="93" isprivate="false" number="383">Pub. L. 93–383,</plaw> title III, §304(h), Aug. 22, 1974, <statuteatlarge page="678" volume="88">88 Stat. 678</statuteatlarge>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the project when the proposed physical improvements are completed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) not to exceed, for such part of the project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $42,048 per family unit without a bedroom, $48,481 per family unit with one bedroom, $58,469 per family unit with two bedrooms, $74,840 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $83,375 per family unit with four or more bedrooms; except that as to projects to consist of elevator-type structures the Secretary may, in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $44,250 per family unit without a bedroom, $50,724 per family unit with one bedroom, $61,680 per family unit with two bedrooms, $79,793 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $87,588 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to compensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design; (B) the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the dollar limitations in subparagraph (A) (as such limitations may have been adjusted in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="1712a" title="12">section 1712a of this title</uscode>) by not to exceed 140 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 140 percent, or 170 percent in high cost areas, where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720 <sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) not to exceed an amount equal to the sum of the unit mortgage amounts determined under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section assuming the mortgagor to be the owner and occupant of each family unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amortization of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects; interest; releases; extent of project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any blanket mortgage insured under subsection (d) of this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed 40 years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the blanket mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the blanket mortgage may provide for such release. The project covered by the blanket mortgage may include four or more family units and such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Entitlement to insurance benefits as provided in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(a) of this title</uscode></h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee under a mortgage insured under subsection (c) of this section is entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(a) of this title</uscode> with respect to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode>, and the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),<sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> (j), and (k) <sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> shall be applicable to the mortgages insured under subsection (c) of this section, except that (1) all references in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, (2) all references therein to <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> shall be construed to refer to subsection (c) of this section, and (3) the excess remaining, referred to in <uscode detail="(f)(1)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(f)(1) of this title</uscode>, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (<em>l</em>), and (n) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> shall be applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:637 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of <uscode edition="2006" range="1715p and 1715u" section="1715p" title="12">sections 1715p and 1715u of this title</uscode> shall be applicable to the mortgages insured under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Increase in maximum insurance amounts for costs incurred from solar energy systems and energy conservation measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may further increase the dollar amount limitations which would otherwise apply under subsection (e) of this section by not to exceed 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of a project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703(a) of this title</uscode>) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42) <sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Rental housing conversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a unit in any project which was converted from rental housing, no insurance may be provided under this section unless (1) the conversion occurred more than one year prior to the application for insurance, (2) the mortgagor or comortgagor was a tenant of that rental housing, (3) the conversion of the property is sponsored by a bona fide tenants organization representing a majority of the households in the project, or (4) before April 20, 1984 (A) application was made to the Secretary for a commitment to insure a mortgage covering any unit in the project, (B) in the case of direct endorsement, the mortgagee received the case number assigned by the Secretary for any unit in the project, or (C) application was made for approval of the project for guarantee, insurance, or direct loan under <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703 of this title</uscode> covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under <uscode edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703 of this title</uscode> due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under <uscode edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703 of this title</uscode> which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments, the homeowner or the cooperative member shall be of lower income and satisfy eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the homeowner shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section but insured under section 1715z–2 of this title may qualify for assistance payments if such mortgage was executed by a mortgagor who is determined not to be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes (but otherwise eligible) under subsection (j)(4) of this section or under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title and accepted as a reasonably satisfactory credit risk under section 1715z–2 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cooperative association of which the family is a member shall operate (A) a housing project the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been financed with a mortgage insured under section 1715e or section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title and which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments and the dwelling unit has had no previous occupant other than the family: <em>Provided</em>, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an applica<!-- PDFPage:641 -->tion with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: <em>Provided further</em>, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715<em>l</em>(f) of this title, or a family which includes five or more minor persons, or a family occupying low-rent public housing: <em>Provided further</em>, That the amount of the mortgage attributable to the dwelling unit shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that costs levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively; or (B) a housing project which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which prior to completion of construction or rehabilitation is approved for receiving the benefits of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on payments on behalf of mortgagor; occupancy of property; maximum amount of payment; recapture of amounts; determination, applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, the assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a mortgagor shall be made during such time as the mortgagor shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage: <em>Provided</em>, That assistance payments may be made on behalf of a homeowner who assumes a mortgage insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section with respect to which assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner, if the homeowner is approved by the Secretary as eligible for receiving such assistance: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r) of this section, entered into after September 30, 1983, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum (4 per centum per annum in the case of a mortgage described in subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this section or where the homeowner rents such a property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family property) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of assistance actually received under this section, other than any amount provided under subsection (e) of this section, or (ii) an amount equal to at least 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “net appreciation of the property” means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage amount as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z–10 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any property with respect to which there is assumption in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection or to any property which is subject to a mortgage, loan, or other advance of credit insured pursuant to subsection (q) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) There hereby is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund, which, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may be used by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out subparagraph (B). There shall be deposited into such fund (i) any amount recaptured under paragraph (2); (ii) any authority to make assistance payments under subsection (a) of this section that is committed for use in a contract but is unused because the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved is refinanced (except to the extent provided in subsection (r) of this section for mortgages insured under such subsection) or because such assistance payments are terminated or suspended for other reasons before the original termination date of such contract; and (iii) any amount received under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any homeowner whose assistance payments are terminated by reason of the 10-year limitation referred to in paragraph (1), and who is determined by the Secretary to be unable to assume the full payments due under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved, the Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of amounts in the fund established in subparagraph (A), contract to make, and make, continued assistance payments on behalf of such homeowner. Such continued assistance payments shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (1) or subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section and for such period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any amounts in such fund determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by, the <!-- PDFPage:642 -->United States or any agency of the United States. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amounts of budget authority or contract authority recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced that are not required for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection, shall be rescinded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on payments on behalf of family holding membership in cooperative association; occupancy; maximum amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a family holding membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project shall be made only during such time as the family is an occupant of such project and shall be in amounts computed on the basis of the formula set forth in subsection (c) of this section applying the cooperative member's proportionate share of the obligations under the project mortgage to the items specified in the formula.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement for expenses in handling the mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (a)(2)(B), (c), (d), (j)(7), or (r) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's or cooperative member's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's (or cooperative member's) income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized, upon application of a mortgagee, to insure under this subsection a mortgage the proceeds of which are used to refinance a mortgage insured under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage must be executed by a mortgagor meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) and shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be a first lien on real estate held in fee simple, or on a leasehold under a lease—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for not less than 99 years which is renewable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) having a period of not less than 10 years to run beyond the maturity date of the mortgage;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have been made to, and held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be in an amount not exceeding the outstanding principal balance, including any unpaid interest, due on the mortgage being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) have a maturity not exceeding the unexpired term of the mortgage being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) bear an interest rate not exceeding such percent per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time as the Secretary finds necessary to meet the mortgage market, taking into consideration the yields on mortgages in the primary and secondary markets; to the extent that the amounts described in paragraphs (4)(A) and (B) are not otherwise paid by the Secretary, the foregoing interest rate may be increased, in the discretion of the Secretary, to compensate the mortgagee for its payment to, or on behalf of, the mortgagor of such amounts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) meet the criteria for refinancing as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (h)(2) of this section, assistance payments in connection with mortgages insured under paragraph (2) shall be made only with respect to a family who is eligible for, and receiving assistance payments with respect to, the insured mortgage being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary is authorized and, to the extent provided in appropriation Acts, may pay to the mortgagor (directly, through the mortgagee, or otherwise)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount, as approved by the Secretary, as an incentive to the mortgagor to re<!-- PDFPage:648 -->finance a mortgage insured under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an amount as approved by the Secretary for costs incurred in connection with the refinancing, including but not limited to discounts, loan origination fees, and closing costs.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Amounts of budget authority required for assistance payments contracts with respect to mortgages insured under this subsection shall be derived from amounts recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced. For purposes of subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, the amount of recaptured budget authority that the Secretary commits for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection shall not be construed as “unused”.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary is authorized to take any actions to identify and communicate with any mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section to implement the refinancing of such mortgages with insurance under this subsection. The Secretary may take such actions directly, or under contract. Notwithstanding the restriction of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="552a" title="5">section 552a(b) of title 5</uscode>, upon the request of an approved mortgagee, the Secretary may disclose to such mortgagee the name and address of any mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section that meets the criteria for refinancing, pursuant to paragraph (2)(F), and the unpaid principal balance and interest rate on such mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall implement the provisions of this subsection by a notice published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) The Secretary shall periodically review each contract under which the Secretary is making assistance payments under this section to determine if a refinancing of the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved will result in a sufficient reduction in assistance payments to warrant such refinancing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(B) In the case of assistance payments contracts in effect on November 9, 1989, the Secretary shall complete such review within 60 days in order to permit the refinancing to be completed during fiscal year 1990.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) For lenders and mortgagees providing refinancing, the payment of reasonable mortgage or loan origination fees, discount points, and other expenses required to refinance; and</p>

The Secretary shall structure refinancings as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(A) Lenders and mortgagees providing refinancings under this subsection may charge an interest rate for refinancing that is not greater than 0.5 percent higher than the prevailing market rate for refinancing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(B) Payments to the homeowner or cooperative member to encourage refinancing shall be paid through a reduction in the monthly payment of the homeowner or cooperative member under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1715z–1. Rental and cooperative housing for lower income families</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of owner of rental housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees <sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <em>Provided further</em>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public <sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term “mortgage insurance premium”, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) For each dwelling unit there shall be established, with the approval of the Secretary, a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The basic rental charge shall be—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The fair market rental charge shall be—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:653 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (iii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">section 1437f of title 42</uscode> that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [<uscode edition="2006" section="4101" title="12">12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.</uscode>] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to, assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) of this section for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1437c" title="42">section 1437c(c) of title 42</uscode>. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on <!-- PDFPage:654 -->a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">section 1437f(c) of title 42</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Assistance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">section 1437f of title 42</uscode> shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Repealed. <plaw congress="104" isprivate="false" number="99">Pub. L. 104–99,</plaw> title IV, §405(d)(2), Jan. 26, 1996, <statuteatlarge page="45" volume="110">110 Stat. 45</statuteatlarge>.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to provide assistance to restore or maintain the financial soundness, to assist in the improvement of the management, to permit capital improvements to be made to maintain certain projects as decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and to maintain the low- to moderate-income character of certain projects assisted or approved for assistance under the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701 </uscode><!-- PDFPage:664 -->et seq.], the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1437" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.</uscode>], the Housing Act of 1959, or the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) may make available, and contract to make available, to such extent and in such amounts as may be approved in appropriation Acts, financial assistance to owners of rental or cooperative housing projects meeting the requirements of this section. Such assistance shall be made on an annual basis and in accordance with the provisions of this section, without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A rental or cooperative housing project is eligible for assistance under this section only if such project—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) is assisted under section 236 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715z" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715z</uscode>–1] or the proviso of section 221(d)(5) of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715</uscode><em>l</em>(d)(5)], or under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701s" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701s</uscode>], or received a loan under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701q" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701q</uscode>] more than 15 years before the date on which assistance is made available under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is assisted under section 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1421b" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1421b</uscode>], as in effect immediately before January 1, 1975, section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1437f" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1437f</uscode>] following conversion to such assistance from assistance under section 236 of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1715z" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1715z</uscode>–1] or section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701s" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701s</uscode>]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) met the criteria specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph before the acquisition of such project by the Secretary and has been sold by the Secretary, subject to a mortgage insured or held by the Secretary and subject to an agreement (in effect during the period of assistance under this section) which provides that the low- and moderate-income character of the project will be maintained; except that, with respect to projects sold after October 1, 1978, assistance shall be available for a period not to exceed three years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets such other requirements consistent with the purposes of this section as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Criteria for granting financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No assistance may be made available under this section unless the Secretary has determined that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such assistance, when considered with other resources available to the project, is necessary and, in the determination of the Secretary, will restore or maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project and maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project, and the owner has agreed to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of such project for a period at least equal to the remaining term of the project mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the assistance which could reasonably be expected to be provided over the useful life of the project will be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives by which the Secretary could maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the owner of the project, together with the mortgagee in the case of a project not insured under the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.</uscode>], has provided or has agreed to provide assistance to the project in such manner as the Secretary may determine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the project is or can reasonably be made structurally sound, as determined on the basis of information obtained as a result of an onsite inspection of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the management of the project is being conducted by persons who meet minimum levels of competency and experience prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the project is being operated and managed in accordance with a management-improvement-and-operating plan which is designed to reduce the operating costs of the project, which has been approved by the Secretary, and which includes the following: (A) a detailed maintenance schedule; (B) a schedule for correcting past deficiencies in maintenance, repairs, and replacements; (C) a plan to upgrade the project to meet cost-effective energy efficiency standards prescribed by the Secretary; (D) a plan to improve financial and management control systems; (E) a detailed annual operating budget taking into account such standards for operating costs in the area as may be determined by the Secretary; and (F) such other requirements as the Secretary may determine; except that the Secretary may excuse an owner from compliance with the plan requirement set forth in this paragraph in any case in which such owner seeks only assistance for capital improvements under this section; and except that the Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove each plan not later than the expiration of the 30-day period beginning upon the date of submission of the plan to the Secretary by the owner, but if the Secretary fails to inform the owner of approval or disapproval of the plan within such period the plan shall be considered to have been approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all reasonable attempts have been made to take all appropriate actions and provide suitable housing for project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the project has a feasible plan to involve the residents in project decisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the affirmative fair housing marketing plan meets applicable requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the owner certifies that it will comply with various equal opportunity statutes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consultation with local officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to making assistance available to a project, the Secretary shall consult with the appropriate officials of the unit of local government in which such project is located and seek assurances that—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:665 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the community in which the project is located is or will provide essential services to the project in keeping with the community's general level of such services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to correct deficiencies in the project which exist at the beginning of the first year with respect to which assistance is made available for the project under this section, which were caused by the deferral of regularly scheduled maintenance and repairs or the failure to make necessary and timely replacements of equipment and other components of the project, and for which payment has not previously been made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project by reducing deficiencies, which exist at the beginning of the first year with respect to which assistance is made available for the project under this section and for which payment has not previously been made, in the reserve funds established by the project owner for the purpose of replacing capital items;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The owner of a project receiving assistance for capital improvements shall agree to contribute assistance to such project in such amounts, from such sources, and in such manner as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may provide assistance for capital improvements under this section if the Secretary finds that the reserve funds established by the owner of a project for the purpose of making capital improvements are insufficient to finance both the capital improvements for which such assistance is to be used and other capital improvements that are reasonably expected to be required in the near future, and such insufficiency is not the result of the failure of such owner to comply with any standard established by the Secretary for management of such reserve funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Amount of assistance for capital improvements; term of loan; rate of interest; allowance for administrative costs and probable program losses; nondischargeable liability; other forms for loans</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">§1715z–2. Special mortgage insurance assistance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to help provide adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, including those who, for reasons of credit history, irregular income patterns caused by seasonal employment, or other factors, are unable to meet the credit requirements of the Secretary for the purchase of a single-family home financed by a mortgage insured under section 1709, 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>, 1715y, or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, but who, through the incentive of homeownership and counseling assistance, appear to be able to achieve homeownership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization to insure mortgages meeting requirements of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized upon application by the mortgagee to insure under this section not more than 26 percent of the total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) of any mortgage meeting the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) meet the requirements of section 1709 (except subsection (m)),<sup><a href="#1715z-2_1_target" name="1715z-2_1">1</a></sup> 1715k(d)(3)(A), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2), (h)(5), (i), 1715y(c), or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees, as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $70,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) be executed by a mortgagor who the Secretary has determined, after a full and complete study of the case, would not be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes under sections 1709, 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>, 1715y, or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, because of his credit standing, debt obligations, total annual income, or income characteristics, but who the Secretary is satisfied would be a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, consistent with the objectives stated in subsection (a) of this section, if he were to receive budget, debt management, and related counseling, prior to and during the 12 months immediately following the purchase of the property, from a community development financial institution under <uscode detail="(5)" edition="2006" section="4702" title="12">section 4702(5) of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That, in determining whether the mortgagor is a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, the Secretary shall review the credit history of the applicant giving special consideration to those delinquent accounts which were ultimately paid by the applicant and to extenuating factors which may have caused credit accounts of the applicant to become delinquent; and the Secretary shall also give special consideration to income characteristics of applicants whose total income over the two years prior to their applications has remained at levels of eligibility (as required under paragraph (4) of this subsection), but who, because of the character of this seasonal employment or for other reasons, have not maintained continuous employment under one employer during that time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require monthly payments which, in combination with local real estate taxes on the property involved, do not exceed 36 per centum of the applicant's income, based on his average monthly income during the year prior to his application or the average monthly income during the three years prior to his application, whichever is higher; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require the mortgagor to be subject, if necessary, to a default mitigation effort undertaken by an intermediary community development financial institution under <uscode detail="(5)" edition="2006" section="4702" title="12">section 4702(5) of this title</uscode>, that is acting as a sponsor and pass-through of insurance under <!-- PDFPage:675 --><uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> and is approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) involve a total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) that is not more than 90 percent of the value of the property for which the mortgage is provided; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) involve a total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in which the mortgagor has equity (as defined by the Secretary) of not less than 10 percent and such equity shall be subordinate to the interest of the Secretary in the mortgaged property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preferences in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services; eligible families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give preference in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services under this section (1) to families which are eligible for assistance payments under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715z" title="12">section 1715z of this title</uscode>, (2) to families living in empowerment zones and enterprise communities (as those terms are defined in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="1393" title="26">section 1393(b) of title 26</uscode> <sup><a href="#1715z-2_2_target" name="1715z-2_2">2</a></sup> who are eligible for homeownership assistance, and (3) to families living in public housing units, especially those families required to leave public housing because their incomes have risen beyond the maximum prescribed income limits, and families eligible for residence in public housing who have been displaced from federally assisted urban renewal areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Budget, debt management, and related counseling services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide, or contract with community development financial institutions under <uscode detail="(5)" edition="2006" section="4702" title="12">section 4702(5) of this title</uscode> to provide, such budget, debt management, and related counseling services to mortgagors whose mortgages are insured under this section as he determines to be necessary to meet the objectives of this section. The Secretary may also provide such counseling to otherwise eligible families who lack sufficient funds to supply a down payment to help them to save an amount necessary for that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aggregate principal balance of mortgages insured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate principal balance of the portions of mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at one time shall not exceed $200,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Premium fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Mortgages insured under this section shall be subject to an insurance premium fee of not more than 1.25 percent of the total mortgage principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Assumption of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before insuring a mortgage under this section, the Secretary shall enter into such contracts or other agreements as may be necessary to ensure that the mortgagee or other holder of the mortgage shall assume not less than 10 percent and not more than 50 percent of any loss on the insured mortgage, subject to any reasonable limit on the liability of the mortgagee or holder of the mortgage that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee or mortgage holder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No guarantees may be issued under <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721(g) of this title</uscode> for the timely payment of interest or principal on securities backed, in whole or in part, by mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of subsection (e) of this section.</p>

For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the property and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>

As used in this section, “supplemental loan” means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made for the purpose of financing improvements or additions to such project, hospital, or facility: <em>Provided</em>, That a loan involving a nursing home, hospital, or a group practice facility may also be made for the purpose of financing equipment to be used in the operation of such nursing home, hospital, or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a supplemental loan shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be limited to 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of such improvements, additions, and equipment, except that such amount when added to the outstanding balance of the mortgage covering the project or facility, shall not exceed the maximum mortgage amount insurable under the section or subchapter pursuant to which the mortgage covering such project or facility is insured or an amount acceptable to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary;</p>

Such loans shall have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary and shall meet such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. In no event shall such a loan be insured if it is for an amount in excess of the maximum amount which could be approved if the outstanding indebtedness, if any, covering the property were a mortgage insured under this chapter. At any sale under foreclosure of a mortgage on a project or facility which is not insured under this chapter but which is senior to a loan assigned to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to bid, in addition to amounts authorized under <uscode detail="(k)" edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713(k) of this title</uscode>, any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by such senior mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not exceed an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary for the purchase and installation of individual utility meters plus an amount which the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:681 -->deems appropriate taking into account amounts which will be saved in operation costs over the period of repayment of the loan by reducing the energy requirements of the project as a result of the installation of energy conserving improvements or a solar energy system therein;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be insured for 90 percent of any loss incurred by the person holding the note for the loan; except that, for cooperative multifamily projects receiving assistance under section 1715z–1 of this title or financed with a below market interest rate mortgage insured under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title, 100 percent of any such loss may be insured;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply to loans insured under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assist the provision of urgently needed hospitals for the care and treatment of persons who are acutely ill or who otherwise require medical care and related services of the kind customarily furnished only (or most effectively) by hospitals. Such assistance shall be provided regardless of the amount of public financial or other support a hospital may receive, and the Secretary shall neither require additional security or collateral to guarantee such support, nor impose more stringent eligibility or other requirements on publicly owned or supported hospitals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term “hospital” means a facility—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which provides community service for inpatient medical care of the sick or injured (including obstetrical care);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 50 per centum of the total patient days of which during any year are customarily assignable to the categories of chronic convalescent and rest, drug and alcoholic, epileptic, mentally deficient, mental, nervous and mental, and tuberculosis, unless the facility is a critical access hospital (as that term is defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Social Security Act (<uscode detail="(mm)(1)" edition="2006" section="1395x" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1395x(mm)(1)</uscode>)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which is a public facility, proprietary facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation or association, licensed or regulated by the State (or, if there is no State law providing for such licensing or regulation by the State, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located); and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms “mortgage” and “mortgagor” shall have the meanings respectfully set forth in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713(a) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:683 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization to insure; prohibition of premiums on guarantees of principal and interest under title VII of the Public Health Service Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to insure any mortgage (including advances on such mortgage during construction) in accordance with the provisions of this section upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and to make commitments for insurance of such mortgage prior to the date of its execution or disbursement thereon. No mortgage insurance premium shall be charged with respect to the amount of principal and interest guaranteed by the Department of Health and Human Services under title VII of the Public Health Service Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="292" title="42">42 U.S.C. 292 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of mortgages covering new or rehabilitated hospitals, including equipment; terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the purpose of this section, the Secretary is authorized to insure any mortgage which covers a new or rehabilitated hospital, including equipment to be used in its operation, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgage shall be executed by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may in his discretion require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to charges and methods of financing, and, in addition thereto, if the mortgagor is a corporate entity, as to capital structure and rate of return. As an aid to the regulation or restriction of any mortgagor with respect to any of the foregoing matters, the Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary. Any stock or interest so purchased shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in the amount requested by the mortgagor if such amount does not exceed 90 percent of the estimated replacement cost of the property or project including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) equipment to be used in the operation of the hospital, when the proposed improvements are completed and the equipment is installed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703(a) of this title</uscode>) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42) <sup><a href="#1715z-7_1_target" name="1715z-7_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The Secretary shall require satisfactory evidence that the hospital will be located in a State or political subdivision of a State with reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation for hospitals and satisfactory assurance that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to the hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall establish the means for determining need and feasibility for the hospital, if the State does not have an official procedure for determining need for hospitals. If the State has an official procedure for determining need for hospitals, the Secretary shall require that such procedure be followed before the application for insurance is submitted, and the application shall document that need has also been established under that procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Secretary shall not insure any mortgage or approve any modification of an existing mortgage insured pursuant to this section or <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2006" section="1715n" title="12">section 1715n(f) of this title</uscode> if such insurance or modification is to be made in connection with a guarantee, as authorized pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721 of this title</uscode>, of a trust certificate or other security which is exempt from Federal taxation or which is to be used to collateralize obligations which are so exempt, except that the Secretary shall not refuse to insure such a mortgage or approve such a modification solely on the basis that such insurance or modification is to be made in connection with a guarantee, as authorized pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721 of this title</uscode>, of a trust certificate or other security which is exempt from Federal taxation or which is to be used to collateralize obligations which are so exempt if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written application for such insurance or modification submitted at the express direction of the hospital has been submitted to the appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services prior to March 29, 1979; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a nonprofit mortgagor which is seeking refinancing or modification of an existing mortgage insured pursuant to this section or <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2006" section="1715n" title="12">section 1715n(f) of this title</uscode>, the mortgagor (i) had engaged an investment banker for the purpose of obtaining such refinancing or modification, or had undertaken or arranged for the undertaking of a market or feasibility study with respect to the advisability of obtaining such refinancing or modification, and had made written notification of its interest in such refinancing or modification to the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Housing and Urban Development prior to June 7, 1979; and (ii) receives from the programs established under titles XVIII [<uscode edition="2006" section="1395" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.</uscode>] and XIX [<uscode edition="2006" section="1396" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.</uscode>] of the Social Security Act a percentage of its total revenue which is greater than 125 per centum of the national average for hospitals which derive revenue from such titles.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall not limit the authority of the Secretary to approve a mortgage increase on any mortgage eligible for insurance under this paragraph at any time prior to final <!-- PDFPage:684 -->endorsement of the loan for insurance; except that such mortgage increase may not be approved for the cost of constructing any improvements not included in the original plans and specifications approved by the Department of Health and Human Services unless approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the extent that a private nonprofit or public facility mortgagor is required by the Secretary to provide cash equity in excess of the amount of the mortgage to complete the project, the mortgagor shall be entitled, at the option of the mortgagee, to fund the excess with a letter of credit. In such event, mortgage proceeds may be advanced to the mortgagor prior to any demand being made on the letter of credit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release of part of property or project from lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property or project from the lien of any mortgage insured under this section upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Encouragement of programs undertaking responsibility to provide comprehensive health care; immediate processing of applications for public hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The activities and functions provided for in this section shall be carried out by the agencies involved so as to encourage programs that undertake responsibility to provide comprehensive health care, including outpatient and preventive care, as well as hospitalization, to a defined population, and, in the case of public hospitals, to encourage programs that are undertaken to provide essential health care services to all residents of a community regardless of ability to pay. The Secretary shall begin immediately to process applications of public facilities for mortgage insurance under this section in accordance with regulations, guidelines, and procedures applicable to facilities of private nonprofit corporations and associations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insurance of mortgages providing permanent financing or refinancing of existing mortgage indebtedness; aggregate principal balance of mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this subchapter, the Secretary may insure under this section a mortgage which provides permanent financing or refinancing of existing mortgage indebtedness in the case of a hospital whose permanent financing is presently lacking, if the construction of such hospital was completed between January 1, 1966, and August 1, 1968.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate principal balance of all mortgages insured under paragraph (1) and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $20,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (<em>l</em>), and (n) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> shall apply to mortgages insured under this section and all references therein to <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> shall be deemed to refer to this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Secretary of necessity; interest subsidy payments; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever he determines such action to be necessary in furtherance of the purposes set forth in section 501 of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of families of middle income. The assistance shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “the investor”) with respect to mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section and made after July 24, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications of mortgagor for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments a middle-income family shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which is (1) insured under subsection (j) of this section, (2) guaranteed under <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>, or (3) a conventional mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (j)(3) of this section. In addition to the foregoing requirement, the Secretary may require that the mortgagor have an income, at the time of acquisition of the property, of not more than the median income for the area in which the property is located, as determined by the Secretary, with appropriate adjustments for smaller and larger families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments authorized by this section shall cease when (1) the mortgagor no longer occupies the property which secures the mortgage, (2) the mortgages are no longer held by the investor, or (3) the rate of interest paid by the mortgagor reaches the rate of interest specified on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monthly mortgage payments as determining eligibility for interest subsidy payments; mortgage assistance payments for middle-income cooperative members; interest subsidy payments; applicability of provisions to cooperative mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Interest subsidy payments shall be on mortgages on which the mortgagor makes monthly payments towards principal and interest equal to an amount which would be required if the mortgage bore an effective interest rate of 7 per centum per annum including any discounts or charges in the nature of points or otherwise (but not including premiums, if any, for mortgage insurance) or such higher rate (not to exceed the rate specified in the mortgage), which the mortgagor could pay by applying at least 20 per centum of his income towards homeownership expenses. As used in this subsection, the term “monthly homeownership expense” includes the monthly payment for principal, interest, mortgage insurance premium, insurance, and taxes due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the mortgages eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments on behalf of cooperative members of middle income. Such assistance payments shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the investor with respect to mortgages insured (subsequent to July 24, 1970) under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> which are executed by cooperatives, the membership in which is limited to middle-income families. For purposes of this paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term “mortgagor”, when used in subsection (b) of this section in the case of a mortgage covering a cooperative housing project, means a member of the cooperative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term “acquisition of the property”, when used in subsection (b) of this section, means the family's application for a dwelling unit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a cooperative mortgagor, subsection (c) of this section shall not apply and the interest subsidy payments shall cease when the mortgage is no longer held by the investor or the cooperative fails to limit membership to families whose incomes at the time of their application for a dwelling unit meets such requirements as are laid down by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments shall be in an amount equal to the difference, as determined by the Secretary, between the total amount of interest per calendar quarter received by the investor on mortgages assisted under this section and purchased by it and the total amount of interest which the investor would have received if the yield on such mortgages was equal to the sum of (1) the average costs (expressed as an annual percentage rate) to it of all borrowed funds outstanding in the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and (2) such per centum per annum as will provide for administrative and other expenses of the investor and a reasonable economic return, as determined by the Secretary to be necessary and appropriate taking into account the purpose of this section to provide additional mortgage credit at reasonable rates of interest to middle-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of the mortgagor's payments pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:687 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to make interest subsidy payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $105,000,000 during the first year of such contracts prior to July 1, 1971, which amount shall be increased by an additional $105,000,000 during the first year of an additional number of such contracts on July 1 of each of the years 1971 and 1972.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No interest subsidy payments under this section shall be made after June 30, 1973, except pursuant to contracts entered into on or before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of family income; exclusion of income of minors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the income of any family for the purposes of this section, income from all sources of each member of the family in the household shall be included, except that the Secretary shall exclude income earned by any minor person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Insurance of mortgages executed by mortgagors meeting eligibility requirements for assistance payments; issuance of commitment; eligibility requirements for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section. Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this subsection: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in the discretion of the Secretary 25 per centum of the authority conferred by this section and subject to all the terms thereof may be used for mortgages on existing housing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) involve a single-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of construction, or a one-family unit in a condominium project (together with an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities serving the project) which is released from a multifamily project, the construction of which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments with respect to such family unit and the unit shall have had no previous occupant other than the mortgagor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) involve a single-family dwelling whose appraised value, as determined by the Secretary, is not in excess of $20,000 (which amount may be increased by not more than 50 per centum in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that the cost level so requires); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid in cash or its equivalent on account of the property (A) 3 per centum of the first $15,000 of the appraised value of the property, (B) 10 per centum of such value in excess of $15,000 but not in excess of $25,000, and (C) 20 per centum of such value in excess of $25,000.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 501 of <plaw congress="91" isprivate="false" number="351">Pub. L. 91–351</plaw> provided that: “The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) periodic episodes of monetary stringency and high interest rates make it extremely difficult for families of middle income to obtain mortgage credit at rates which they can afford to pay;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) periods of monetary stringency and high interest rates are directly related to the Government's monetary and fiscal policies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) a disproportionate share of the burden of sustaining these anti-inflationary policies of the Government falls on families of middle income who are buyers or prospective buyers of homes; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) the Government has a responsibility to lessen the disproportionate burden which such families bear as a result of such policies.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">It is the purpose of this title [enacting this section, and amending sections 1715z–3 and 1719 of this title] to provide, during periods of high mortgage interest rates, a source of mortgage credit for such families which is within their financial means.”</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary; request of mortgagee; premium charges; provisions of contract of co-insurance; non-applicability of state insurance laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to providing insurance as otherwise authorized under this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary, upon request of any mortgagee and for such mortgage insurance premium as he may prescribe (which premium, or other charges to be paid by the mortgagor, shall not exceed the premium, or other charges, that would otherwise be applicable), may insure and make a commitment to insure under any provision of this subchapter any mortgage, advance, or loan otherwise eligible under such provision, pursuant to a co-insurance contract providing that the mortgagee will—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:688 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume a percentage of any loss on the insured mortgage, advance, or loan in direct proportion to the amount of the co-insurance, which co-insurance shall not be less than 10 per centum, subject to any reasonable limit or limits on the liability of the mortgagee that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) carry out (under a delegation or otherwise and with or without compensation but subject to audit, exception, or review requirements) such credit approval, appraisal, inspection, commitment, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary, pursuant to regulations, shall approve as consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any contract of co-insurance under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of mortgage reserves, manner of calculating insurance benefits, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees (which may elect not to be subject to the loss sharing provisions), and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. A mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall not by reason of such contract, or its adherence to such contract or applicable regulations of the Secretary, including provisions relating to the retention of risks in the event of sale or assignment of a mortgage, be made subject to any State law regulating the business of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of construction of dwellings or projects as prerequisite; minimum standards or criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No insurance shall be granted pursuant to this section with respect to dwellings or projects approved for insurance prior to the beginning of construction unless the inspection of such construction is conducted in accordance with at least the minimum standards and criteria used with respect to dwellings or projects approved for mortgage insurance pursuant to other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repealed. <plaw congress="100" isprivate="false" number="242">Pub. L. 100–242,</plaw> title IV, §414(a), Feb. 5, 1988, <statuteatlarge page="1907" volume="101">101 Stat. 1907</statuteatlarge></h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability unaffecting insurance otherwise authorized; criteria for exercise of authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not withdraw, deny, or delay insurance otherwise authorized under any other provision of this chapter by reason of the availability of insurance pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall exercise his authority under this section only to the extent that he finds that the continued exercise of such authority will not adversely affect the flow of mortgage credit to older and declining neighborhoods and to the purchasers of older and lower cost housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Multifamily housing project; contract provisions; aggregate principal amount of all mortgages insured; loans on defaulted mortgages; insurance for state assisted projects and projects under construction; definitions; amount of reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where the mortgage covers a multifamily housing project, the co-insurance contract may provide that the mortgagee assume (i) the full amount of any loss on the insured mortgage up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of claim for insurance benefits, or (ii) the full amount of any losses on insured mortgages in a portfolio of mortgages approved by the Secretary up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of all mortgages in such portfolio at the time of claim for insurance benefits on a mortgage in the portfolio, plus a share of any loss in excess of the amount under clause (i) or (ii), whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make loans, from the applicable insurance fund, to public housing agencies in connection with mortgages which have been insured pursuant to this subsection and which are in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may insure and make a commitment to insure in connection with a co-insurance contract pursuant to this subsection (A) a mortgage on a project assisted under the second proviso in the first sentence of section 1715z–1(b) of this title, and (B) a mortgage or advance on a mortgage made to a public housing agency on a project under construction which is not approved for insurance prior to construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) As used in this subsection, the term “public housing agency” has the meaning given such term in <uscode detail="(b)(6)" edition="2006" section="1437a" title="42">section 1437a(b)(6) of title 42</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may include in the determination of replacement cost of a project to be covered by a mortgage made to a public housing agency and insured pursuant to this subsection, such reserves and development costs, not to exceed 5 per centum of the amount otherwise allowable, as may be established or authorized by the public housing agency consistent with such agency's procedures and underwriting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Redesignated (f)</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Acceptable co-insurance provisions for rental rehabilitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a mortgage insured under <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2006" section="1715n" title="12">section 1715n(f) of this title</uscode> secured by property which is to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437<em>o</em> <sup><a href="#1715z-9_1_target" name="1715z-9_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, such co-insurance may include provisions that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) insurance benefits shall equal the sum of (A) 90 per centum of the mortgage on the date of institution of foreclosure proceedings (or on the date of acquisition of the property otherwise after default), and (B) 90 per centum of interest arrears on the date benefits are paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the mortgagee shall remit to the Secretary, for credit to the General Insurance <!-- PDFPage:689 -->Fund, 90 per centum of any proceeds of the property, including sale proceeds, net of the mortgagee's actual and reasonable costs related to the property and the enforcement of security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payment of such benefits shall be made in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the underwriter of co-insurance may reinsure 10 per centum of the mortgage amount with a private mortgage insurance company or with a State mortgage insurance agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) <sup><a href="#1715z-9_2_target" name="1715z-9_2">2</a></sup> Authority of mortgagee to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance; terms and conditions respecting retention of co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall have the authority to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance to a warehouse bank or other financial institution which provides interim funding for a loan co-insured under this section, and to retain the co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) <sup><a href="#1715z-9_2_target" name="1715z-9_2">2</a></sup> Annual review of, and assessment of compliance with, requirements; report; adjustment of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by January 15 and July 15 of each year (1) review the adequacy of capital and other requirements for mortgagees under this section, (2) assess the compliance by mortgagees with such requirements, and (3) make such adjustment to such requirements as the Secretary, after providing opportunity for hearing, determines to be appropriate to improve the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. Such requirements shall include the minimum capital or net worth of mortgagees; the ratio that mortgagees shall maintain between the mortgagee's capital and the volume of mortgages co-insured by such mortgagee; and such other requirements as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the review and assessment under the previous sentence, and an explanation of the Secretary's reasons for making any adjustment in requirements authorized under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; principal obligation limitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family income or with monthly payments and outstanding balances adjusted by a percentage change in a selected price index to the extent he determines such mortgages or loans (1) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs, (2) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special <!-- PDFPage:691 -->risks of such mortgages, and (3) have a potential for acceptance in the private market. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the principal obligation (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) of a mortgage insured pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 97 per centum of the appraised value of the property covered by the mortgage as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inapplicability of principal obligation limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan which meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and which has provisions for varying rates of amortization if the Secretary determines—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the mortgagor could not reasonably afford to purchase the dwelling unit by means of a mortgage insured under subsection (a) of this section or any other mortgage insurance program under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b) of this title</uscode> as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) will not at any time be scheduled to exceed 97 per centum of the projected value of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the principal obligation of the mortgage thereafter will not exceed 113 per centum of the initial appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Mortgage insurance under this subsection shall be limited to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding three years. For the purpose of this subsection, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of the property at a rate not in excess of 21/2 per centum per annum. The number of mortgages which are insured in accordance with this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed (A) that number of mortgages the aggregate initial principal obligation of which equals 10 per centum of the aggregate amount of the initial principal obligation of all mortgages secured by properties improved by one- to four-family residences which are insured under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year, or (B) 50,000 mortgages, whichever is greater. No loan or mortgage may be insured under this subsection after February 5, 1988, except pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into on or before February 5, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages with monthly adjustments based on selected price index; priority; regulations; number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan that meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and that has provisions permitting adjustment of monthly payments and outstanding principal according to changes or percentages of changes in a selected price index if the Secretary determines—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b) of this title</uscode> as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the monthly payments and principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter will not at any time be increased at a rate greater than the percentage change in the price index stipulated in the initial mortgage or loan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall give a priority to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding 3 years. The Secretary shall, not later than March 31, 1984, prescribe regulations establishing guidelines governing mortgages and loans described in this subsection and shall, to the extent practicable, conduct a demonstration program to insure mortgages and loans in accordance with this subsection during fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this subsection and section 1715z–17 of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multifamily housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter relating to multifamily housing projects, mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in project income, to the extent the Secretary determines such mortgages or loans (A) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs; (B) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors, tenants, or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages; and (C) have a potential for acceptance in the private market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the principal obligation of a mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not exceed initially the percentage of the initial appraised value or replacement cost of the property involved that is required by the provision of this subchapter under which such property is insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed 100 percent of the projected value of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the projected value of a property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of such property at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per annum.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:692 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, etc., provision limiting interest or requiring minimum amortization of principal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this section which contains or sets forth any graduated mortgage provisions (including but not limited to provisions for adding deferred interest to principal) which are authorized under this section and applicable regulations, or which have been insured on the basis of their being so authorized, shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule or public policy (1) limiting the amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, or the manner of calculating such interest (including but not limited to prohibitions against the charging of interest on interest), if such constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule would not apply to the mortgage or loan in the absence of such graduated payment mortgage provisions, or (2) requiring a minimum amortization of principal under the mortgage or loan.</p>

A grant provided under this subsection during fiscal years 2006 through 2010 shall be available only to the extent that appropriations are made in advance for such purposes and shall not be derived from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer of unoccupied and substandard housing to local governments and community development corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Transfer authority</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified HUD properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term “qualified HUD property” means any property for which, as of the date that notification of the property is first made under paragraph <!-- PDFPage:694 -->(3)(B), not less than 6 months have elapsed since the later of the date that the property was acquired by the Secretary or the date that the property was determined to be unoccupied or substandard, that is owned by the Secretary and is—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such units and corporations to express interest in the transfer under this subsection of such properties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a right of first refusal for transfer of qualified HUD properties to units of general local government and community development corporations, under which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary shall establish a period during which the Secretary may not transfer such properties except to such units and corporations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary shall offer qualified HUD properties that are single family properties for purchase by units of general local government at a cost of $1 for each property, but only to the extent that the costs to the Federal Government of disposal at such price do not exceed the costs to the Federal Government of disposing of property subject to the procedures for single family property established by the Secretary pursuant to the authority under the last sentence of <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(g) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the Secretary may accept an offer to purchase a property made by a community development corporation only if the offer provides for purchase on a cost recovery basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Secretary shall accept an offer to purchase such a property that is made during such period by such a unit or corporation and that complies with the requirements of this paragraph; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a written explanation, to any unit of general local government or community development corporation making an offer to purchase a qualified HUD property under this subsection that is not accepted, of the reason that such offer was not acceptable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any qualified HUD property, if the Secretary does not receive an acceptable offer to purchase the property pursuant to the procedure established under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall dispose of the property to the unit of general local government in which property is located or to community development corporations located in such unit of general local government on a negotiated, competitive bid, or other basis, on such terms as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Satisfaction of indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before transferring ownership of any qualified HUD property pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall satisfy any indebtedness incurred in connection with the property to be transferred, by canceling the indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Determination of status of properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To ensure compliance with the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall take the following actions:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Upon enactment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon the enactment of this subsection [December 21, 2000], the Secretary shall promptly assess each residential property owned by the Secretary to determine whether such property is a qualified HUD property.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Updates</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Tenant leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not affect the terms or the enforceability of any contract or lease entered into with respect to any residential property before the date that such property becomes a qualified HUD property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Use of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Property transferred under this subsection shall be used only for appropriate neighborhood revitalization efforts, including homeownership, rental units, commercial space, and parks, consistent with local zoning regulations, local building codes, and subdivision regulations and restrictions of record.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Inapplicability to properties made available for homeless</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to such special conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, may insure under any provision of this subchapter that authorizes such insurance, a mortgage covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence, without regard to any limitation in this chapter relating to marketability of title or any other limitation in this chapter that the Secretary determines is contrary to promoting the availability of such insurance on Indian reservations if the mortgage (1) is executed by an Indian tribe and the property is located on trust or otherwise restricted land; or (2) is executed by a member of an Indian tribe who will use the property as a principal residence and the property is on trust or otherwise restricted land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction advances; percentage limitation on amount of principal obligation; pledge of income from tribal resources or assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the Secretary may require an Indian tribe, only as a condition of insurance made under this subchapter pursuant to this section, to pledge income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets not subject to a restriction by the Secretary of the Interior or pledge grants under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [<uscode edition="2006" section="5301" title="42">42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.</uscode>] or any other Federal grant program administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to be used to reimburse the Secretary for any mortgage insurance claims paid in connection with residences insured pursuant to this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual Indian mortgagor, the Secretary may require a pledge of his or her share of distributed income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets, excluding any Federal grants received by the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lack of tribal or trust fund income</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgage as obligation of General Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the insurance of a mortgage using the authority contained in this section shall be the obligation of the General Insurance Fund established in <uscode edition="2006" section="1735c" title="12">section 1735c of this title</uscode>. The mortgagee shall be eligible to receive the benefits of insurance as provided in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section, except that (1) all references in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to <!-- PDFPage:698 -->refer to the General Insurance Fund; and (2) all references in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> to <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> shall be construed to refer to the section under which the mortgage is insured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Availability of status and payment history of loans; entitlement to benefit of insurance; reinstatement of loan upon cure of default; garnishment proceedings; foreclosure proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall make information regarding the status and payment history of loans insured under this section available to local credit bureaus and prospective creditors. Prior to accepting assignment of a mortgage, the Secretary shall require mortgagees to submit documentation that mortgagors have been counseled in a face-to-face interview, informed of the provisions of this subsection or other available assistance, and provided with the names and addresses of officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to whom further communications shall be addressed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the requirement for conveyance of title under <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode>, a mortgagee under this section shall be entitled to receive the benefit of insurance under this section in the case of a mortgage which is more than 90 days in default upon conveyance of the lease agreement and the mortgage documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that any default is cured, the Secretary shall seek to reinstate the loan with the mortgagee or another mortgagee. For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary may provide appropriate financial incentives to reinstate the loan commensurate with sound management of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary determines that a mortgagor is not making a good-faith effort to cure a default, and that trust fund or tribal income is available under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall commence proceedings for the garnishment of the mortgagor's distributed share of tribal or trust fund income in order to collect loan payments that are past due. Proceedings under this paragraph may be instituted in a tribal court, court of competent jurisdiction designated by the tribe, or Federal district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary determines such action is necessary to protect the General Insurance Fund from undue loss, the Secretary may initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to any mortgage acquired under this subsection. Such proceeding may take place in a tribal court, a court of competent jurisdiction, or Federal district court. Any such court shall have jurisdiction to convey to the Secretary the remaining life of a lease on the real property and to order eviction of the delinquent mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Premium charge for insurance; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of this section, the Secretary shall establish a premium charge for insurance that will be sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, except that such charge may not exceed 3 percent per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage outstanding at any time. Not later than September 30, 1984, the Secretary shall determine and report to the Congress on the feasibility of eliminating any excess amount of the premium under this section over the premium under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode>. In the event such premiums are not sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, the Secretary shall make recommendations to the Congress about changes to the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) “Indian tribe” and “trust or otherwise restricted land” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term “Indian tribe” means any Indian or Alaska native tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians or Alaska natives recognized as eligible for the services provided to Indians or Alaska natives by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as such an entity, or that was an eligible recipient under <uscode chapter="67" edition="2006" title="31">chapter 67 of title 31</uscode>, prior to the repeal of such chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “trust or otherwise restricted land” means (A) that area of land, as defined by the Secretary of the Interior, over which an Indian tribe is recognized by the United States as having governmental jurisdiction; (B) land held in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation; or (C) land acquired by Alaska natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1601" title="43">43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.</uscode>] or any other land acquired by Alaska natives pursuant to statute by virtue of their unique status as Alaska natives.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families, Indian housing authorities, and Indian tribes, who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian lands, the Secretary may guarantee not to exceed 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on any loan eligible under subsection (b) of this section made to an Indian family, Indian housing authority, or Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans guaranteed pursuant to this section shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible borrowers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loans shall be made only to borrowers who are Indian families, Indian housing authorities, or Indian tribes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be used to construct, acquire, refinance, or rehabilitate 1- to 4-family dwellings that are standard housing and are located on trust land or land located in an Indian or Alaska Native area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan may be secured by any collateral authorized under existing Federal law or applicable State or tribal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be made only by a lender approved by and meeting qualifications established by the Secretary, except that loans otherwise insured or guaranteed by an agency of the Federal Government or made by an organization of Indians from amounts borrowed from the United States shall not be eligible for guarantee under this section. The following lenders are deemed to be approved under this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in the single family mortgage insurance program under title II of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1707" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any lender whose housing loans under <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode> are automatically guaranteed pursuant to section 1802(d) <sup><a href="#1715z-13a_1_target" name="1715z-13a_1">1</a></sup> of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any lender approved by the Secretary of Agriculture to make guaranteed loans for single family housing under the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1441" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any other lender that is supervised, approved, regulated, or insured by any agency of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be made for a term not exceeding 30 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bear interest (exclusive of the guarantee fee under section 404 <sup><a href="#1715z-13a_2_target" name="1715z-13a_2">2</a></sup> and service charges, if any) at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender and determined by the Secretary to be reasonable, which may not exceed the rate generally charged in the area (as determined by the Secretary) for home mortgage loans not guaranteed or insured by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) involve a principal obligation not exceeding—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property as of the date the loan is accepted for guarantee (or 98.75 percent if the value of the property is $50,000 or less); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certificate of guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the Secretary approves any loan for guarantee under this section, the lender shall submit the application for the loan to the Secretary for examination.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a loan for guarantee under this section and issue a certificate under this paragraph only if the Secretary determines there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certificate of guarantee issued under this paragraph by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guarantee under the provisions of this section and the amount of such guarantee. Such evidence shall be incontestable in the hands of the bearer and the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts agreed to be paid by the Secretary as security for such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fraud and misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection may not be construed to preclude the Secretary from establishing defenses against the original lender based on fraud or material misrepresentation or to bar the Sec<!-- PDFPage:700 -->retary from establishing by regulations in effect on the date of issuance or disbursement, whichever is earlier, partial defenses to the amount payable on the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall fix and collect a guarantee fee for the guarantee of loans under this section, which may not exceed the amount equal to 1 percent of the principal obligation of the loan. The fee shall be paid by the lender at time of issuance of the guarantee and shall be adequate, in the determination of the Secretary, to cover expenses and probable losses. The Secretary shall deposit any fees collected under this subsection in the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund established under subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability under guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The liability under a guarantee provided under this section shall decrease or increase on a pro rata basis according to any decrease or increase in the amount of the unpaid obligation under the provisions of the loan agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any loan guaranteed under this section, including the security given for the loan, may be sold or assigned by the lender to any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the Federal Government or of any State or the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disqualification of lenders and civil money penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) of this section has failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, or has engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of a borrower or the United States, the Secretary may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) refuse, either temporarily or permanently, to guarantee any further loans made by such lender or holder;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bar such lender or holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that such lender or holder assume not less than 10 percent of any loss on further loans made or held by the lender or holder that are guaranteed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil money penalties for intentional violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) of this section has intentionally failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, or to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty on such lender or holder in the manner and amount provided under section 536 of the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1735f" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1735f</uscode>–14] with respect to mortgagees and lenders under such Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment on loans made in good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary may not refuse to pay pursuant to a valid guarantee on loans of a lender or holder barred under this subsection if the loans were previously made in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Payment under guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lender options</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary. Upon providing such notice, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall be entitled to payment under the guarantee (subject to the provisions of this section) and may proceed to obtain payment in one of the following manners:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The holder of the certificate may initiate foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of such action to the Secretary) and upon a final order by the court authorizing foreclosure and submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the certificate the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) plus reasonable fees and expenses as approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the lender holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) No foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under clause (i) continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to the Secretary a request to assign the obligation and security interest to the Secretary in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. The Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States. Upon assignment, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under subsection (e) of this section). The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before any payment under a guarantee is made under subparagraph (A), the holder of the guarantee shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be as<!-- PDFPage:701 -->signed to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event of a default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section involving a security interest in restricted Indian land, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian housing authority serving the tribe or tribes. If the mortgagee or the Secretary subsequently proceeds to liquidate the account, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to one of the entities described in the preceding sentence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Demonstration mortgage risk-sharing program; areas; number of mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to authorize a demonstration mortgage risk-sharing program designed to test the feasibility of entering into risk-sharing contracts with private mortgage insurers and with insured community development financial institutions in order to reduce Government risk and administrative costs, and to speed mortgage processing. The Secretary shall limit the demonstration under this section to not more than four administrative regions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and shall assure that the program is in the financial interest of the Government and will not result in loss of employment by any employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development before the expiration of the 5-year period beginning on December 21, 2000. The aggregate number of mortgages for which risk of nonpayment is shared under this section in any administrative region of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in any fiscal year may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter in such region during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements for private mortgage insurance companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary is authorized, in providing mortgage insurance with respect to one- to four-family dwellings under sections 1709(b), 1715y, and 1715z–10 of this title, to enter into risk-sharing contracts with private mortgage insurance companies which have been determined to be qualified insurers under <uscode detail="(b)(2)(C)" edition="2006" section="1717" title="12">section 1717(b)(2)(C) of this title</uscode> and with insured community development financial institutions. Such contracts shall require private mortgage insurance companies and insured community development financial institutions to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume a secondary percentage of loss on any mortgage insured pursuant to section 1709(b), 1715y, or 1715z–10 of this title covering a one- to four-family dwelling, which percentage of loss shall be set forth in the risk-sharing contract, with the first percentage of loss to be borne by the Secretary; <sup><a href="#1715z-14_1_target" name="1715z-14_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) perform or delegate underwriting, credit approval, appraisal, inspection, commitment, claims processing, property disposition, or <!-- PDFPage:709 -->other functions as the Secretary shall approve as consistent with the purposes of this section and shall set forth in the risk-sharing contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Required contract provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for risk-sharing under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums received by the Secretary with a private mortgage insurer or insured community development financial institution on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of loss reserves, manner of calculating claims on such risk-sharing contract, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees, and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. Pursuant to a contract under this section, a private mortgage insurance company or insured community development financial institution shall endorse loans for risk-sharing and take such other actions on behalf of the Secretary and in the Secretary's name as the Secretary may authorize.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgages offered for inclusion by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require any private mortgage insurance company or insured community development financial institution participating in the program under this section to provide risk-sharing for those mortgages offered by the Secretary for inclusion in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insured community development financial institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term “insured community development financial institution” means a community development financial institution, as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="4702" title="12">section 4702 of this title</uscode> that is an insured depository institution (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1813" title="12">section 1813 of this title</uscode>) or an insured credit union (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1752" title="12">section 1752 of this title</uscode>).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family dwellings; maximum term of mortgage; adjustments in effective rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage involving property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by one to four families, where the mortgage provides for periodic adjustments by the mortgagee in the effective rate of interest charged. Such interest rate adjustments may be accomplished through adjustments in the monthly payment amount, the outstanding principal balance, or the mortgage term, or a combination of these factors, except that in no case may any extension of a mortgage term result in a total term in excess of 40 years. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall (1) be made on an annual basis; (2) be limited, with respect to any single interest rate increase, to no more than 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance; and (3) be limited to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Written explanation of mortgage features</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require that the mortgagee make available to the mortgagor, at the time of loan application, a written explanation of the features of an adjustable rate mortgage consistent with the disclosure requirements applicable to variable rate mortgages secured by a principal dwelling under the Truth in Lending Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1601" title="15">15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Number of mortgages and loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this section in any fiscal year <!-- PDFPage:711 -->may not exceed 30 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustable rate mortgage with initial fixed rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure under this subsection a mortgage that meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, except that the effective rate of interest—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be fixed for a period of not less than the first 3 years of the mortgage term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be adjusted by the mortgagee initially upon the expiration of such period and annually thereafter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of the initial interest rate adjustment, is subject to the 1 percent limitation only if the interest rate remained fixed for 3 or fewer years.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The disclosure required under subsection (b) of this section shall be required for a mortgage insured under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter that is inconsistent with this section, the Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter providing for insurance of mortgages on properties upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by one to four families, a mortgage secured by a first lien on such a property or on the stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides for the mortgagee to share in a predetermined percentage of the property's or stock's net appreciated value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) bears interest at a rate which meets criteria prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides for amortization over a period of not to exceed 30 years, but the actual term of the mortgage (excluding any refinancing) may be not less than 10 nor more than 30 years, and contains such provisions relating to refinancing of the principal balance of the mortgage and any contingent deferred interest as the Secretary may provide; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) meets such other conditions as the Secretary may require by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of mortgagee's share of net appreciated value; “net appreciated value” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgagee's share of a property's or stock's net appreciated value shall be payable upon sale or transfer (as defined by the Secretary) of the property or stock or payment in full of the mortgage, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this section, the term “net appreciated value” means the amount by which the sales price of the property or stock (less the mortgagor's selling costs) exceeds the value of the property or stock at the time the commitment to insure is issued (with adjustments for capital improvements stipulated in the loan contract). If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entitlement of mortgagee upon default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of insurance in accordance with <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(a) of this title</uscode>, but such insurance benefits shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value. The term “original principal obligation of the mortgage” as used in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Inapplicability of State constitution, statute, etc., limiting or prohibiting increases in outstanding loan balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Mortgages insured pursuant to this section which contain provisions for sharing appreciation or which otherwise require or permit increases in the outstanding loan balance which are authorized under this section or under applicable regulations shall not be subject to any <!-- PDFPage:712 -->State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Encouraged use of insurance by low and moderate income families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall encourage the use of insurance under this section by low and moderate income tenants who would otherwise be displaced by the conversion of their rental housing to condominium or cooperative ownership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consumer protections and disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe adequate consumer protections and disclosure requirements with respect to mortgages insured under this section, and may prescribe such other terms and conditions as may be appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Number of mortgages and loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this section and section 1715z–10(c) of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Five or more family units; requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter that is inconsistent with this section, the Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter providing for insurance of mortgages on properties including 5 or more family units, a mortgage secured by a first lien on the property that (1) provides for the mortgagee to share in a predetermined percentage of the property's net appreciated value; and (2) meets such other conditions, including limitations on the rate of interest which may be charged, as the Secretary may require by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of mortgagee's share of net appreciated value; term of mortgage; repayment; “net appreciated value” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgagee's share of a property's net appreciated value shall be payable upon maturity or upon payment in full of the loan or sale or transfer (as defined by the Secretary) of the property, whichever occurs first. The term of the mortgage shall not be less than 15 years, and shall be repayable in equal monthly installments of principal and fixed interest during the mortgage term in an amount which would be sufficient to retire a debt with the same principal and fixed interest rate over a period not exceeding 30 years. In the case of a mortgage which will not be completely amortized during the mortgage term, the principal obligation of the mortgage may not exceed 85 percent of the estimated value of the property or project. For purposes of this section, the term “net appreciated value” means the amount by which the sales price of the property (less the mortgagor's selling costs) exceeds the actual project cost after completion, as approved by the Secretary. If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entitlement of mortgagee upon default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of insurance in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode>, but such insurance benefits shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value. The term “original principal face amount of the mortgage” as used in <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maximum percentage of net appreciated value; disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish by regulation the maximum percentage of net appreciated value which may be payable to a mortgagee as the mortgagee's share. The Secretary shall also establish disclosure requirements applicable to mortgagees making mortgage loans pursuant to this section, to assure that mortgagors are informed of the characteristics of such mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, statute, etc., limiting or prohibiting increases in outstanding loan balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Mortgages insured pursuant to this section which contain provisions for sharing appreciation or which otherwise require or permit increases in the outstanding loan balance which are authorized under this section or under applicable regulations shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to delegate authority to a mortgagee under this section, the Secretary shall consider the experience and performance of the mortgagee compared to the default rate of all insured mortgages in comparable markets, and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate to minimize risk of loss to the insurance funds under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement of insurance requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If a mortgagee to which the Secretary has made a delegation under this section violates the requirements and procedures established by the Secretary or the Secretary determines that other good cause exists, the Secretary may cancel a delegation of authority under this section to the mortgagee by giving notice to the mortgagee. Such a cancellation shall be effective upon receipt of the notice by the mortgagee or at a later date specified by the Secretary.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation; succession; principal and other offices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is created a body corporate to be known as the “Federal National Mortgage Association”, which shall be in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The partition transaction effected pursuant to the foregoing paragraph constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of <uscode detail="(a)(1)(E)" edition="2006" section="368" title="26">section 368(a)(1)(E) of title 26</uscode>; and for the purposes of such title 26, no gain or loss is recognized by the previously existing body corporate by reason of the partition, and the basis and holding period of the assets of the corporation immediately following such partition are the same as the basis and holding period of such assets immediately prior to such partition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purchase and sale of insured and conventional mortgages; transactions in loans and advances of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes set forth in <uscode edition="2006" section="1716" title="12">section 1716 of this title</uscode> and subject to the limitations and restrictions of this subchapter, each of the bodies corporate named in subsection (a)(2) of this section is authorized pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any mortgages which are insured under this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1471" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.</uscode>], or which are insured or guaranteed under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>; and to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any loans made or guaranteed under part B of title VI of the Public Health Service Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="291j" title="42">42 U.S.C. 291j</uscode>–1 et seq.]; and the corporation is authorized to lend on the security of any such mortgages and to purchase, sell, or otherwise deal in any securities guaranteed by the Association under <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721(g) of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That (1) the Association may not purchase any mortgage at a price exceeding 100 per centum of the unpaid principal amount thereof at the time of purchase, with adjustments for interest and any comparable items; (2) the Association may not purchase any mortgage, except a mortgage insured under title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1471" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.</uscode>], if it is offered by, or covers property held by, a State, territorial, or municipal instrumentality; and (3) the Association may not purchase any mortgage under section 1720 <sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title, except a mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715k" title="12">section 1715k of this title</uscode> or subchapter VIII of this chapter or <uscode detail="(k)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(k) of this title</uscode>, or under subchapter IX–A <sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this chapter with respect to a new community approved under section 1749cc–1 <sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title, or insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> and covering property located in an urban renewal area, or a mortgage covering property located in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii, if the original principal obligation thereof exceeds or exceeded $55,000 in the case of property upon which is located a dwelling designed principally for a one-family residence; or $60,000 in the case of a two- or three-family residence; or $68,750 in the case of a four-family residence; or, in the case of a property containing more than four dwelling units, $38,000 per dwelling unit (or such higher amount not in excess of $45,000 per dwelling unit as the Secretary may by regulation specify in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require) for that part of the property attributable to dwelling use. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (3) of the preceding sentence, the Association may purchase a mortgage under section 1720 <sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title with an original principal obligation which exceeds the otherwise applicable maximum amount per dwelling unit if the mortgage is insured under section 1713(c)(3), 1715e(b)(2), 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iii), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3)(ii), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(4)(ii), 1715v(c)(2), 1715y(e)(3), or 1715z–1 of this title. For the purposes of this subchapter, the terms “mortgages” and “home mortgages” shall be inclusive of any mortgages or other loans insured under any of the provisions of this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1471" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes set forth in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1716" title="12">section 1716(a) of this title</uscode>, the corporation is authorized, pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, or otherwise deal in mortgages which are not insured or guaranteed as provided in paragraph (1) (such mortgages referred to hereinafter as “conventional mortgages”). No such purchase of a conventional mortgage secured by a property comprising one- to four-family dwelling units shall be made if the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of purchase exceeds 80 per centum of the value of the property securing the mortgage, unless (A) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; (B) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default; or (C) that portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a conventional mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (A) of such sentence. The corporation may purchase a conventional mortgage which was originated more than one year prior to the purchase date only if the seller is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or any other seller currently engaged in mortgage lending or investing activities. For the purpose of this section, the term “conventional mortgages” shall include a mortgage, lien, or other security interest on the stock or membership certificate issued to a tenant-stockholder or resident-member of a cooperative housing cor<!-- PDFPage:728 -->poration, as defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="216" title="26">section 216 of title 26</uscode>, and on the proprietary lease, occupancy agreement, or right of tenancy in the dwelling unit of the tenant-stockholder or resident-member in such cooperative housing corporation. The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages that are purchased by it; in any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of the mortgage and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed $93,750 for a mortgage secured by a single-family residence, $120,000 for a mortgage secured by a two-family residence, $145,000 for a mortgage secured by a three-family residence, and $180,000 for a mortgage secured by a four-family residence, except that such maximum limitations shall be adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning with 1981. Each such adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the percentage increase during the twelve-month period ending with the previous October in the national average one-family house price in the monthly survey of all major lenders conducted by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The foregoing limitations may be increased by not to exceed 50 per centum with respect to properties located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit for the purchase and installation of home improvements, including energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems described in the last paragraph of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2006" section="1703" title="12">section 1703(a) of this title</uscode> and residential energy conservation measures as described in section 210(11) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [<uscode detail="(11)" edition="2006" section="8211" title="42">42 U.S.C. 8211(11)</uscode>] <sup><a href="#1717_3_target" name="1717_3">3</a></sup> and financed by a public utility in accordance with the requirements of title II of such Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="8211" title="42">42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.</uscode>]. To be eligible for purchase, any such loan or advance of credit (other than a loan or advance made with respect to energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems or residential energy conservation measures) not insured under subchapter I of this chapter shall be secured by a lien against the property to be improved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit secured by mortgages or other liens against manufactured homes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in (i) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a one- to four-family residence that is the principal residence of the mortgagor; and (ii) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a property comprising five or more family dwelling units. If the corporation, pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), shall have purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with any other outstanding mortgage secured by the same residence, the aggregate original amount of such other mortgage and the mortgage authorized to be purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with under this paragraph shall not exceed the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages described in subparagraph (A). In any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of such mortgage described in subparagraph (A) and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed (i) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(i), 50 per centum of the single-family residence mortgage limitation determined under paragraph (2); and (ii) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) No subordinate mortgage against a one- to four-family residence shall be purchased by the corporation if the total outstanding indebtedness secured by the property as a result of such mortgage exceeds 80 per centum of the value of such property unless (i) that portion of such total outstanding indebtedness that exceeds such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation; (ii) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; or (iii) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a subordinate mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (ii) of such sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The corporation may not implement any new program (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of this title</uscode>) before obtaining the approval of the Secretary under <uscode edition="2006" section="4542" title="12">section 4542 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of trusts; obligations of departments and agencies of the United States; exemption of interest income from taxation; authorization of appropriations for differential reimbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law, the Association is authorized under <uscode edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721 of this title</uscode> to create, accept, execute, and otherwise administer in all respects such trusts, receiverships, conservatorships, liquidating or other agencies, or other fiduciary and representative undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called “trusts”, as might be appropriate for financing purposes; and in relation thereto the Association may acquire, hold and manage, dispose of, and otherwise deal in any mortgages or other types of obligations in which any department or agency of the United States listed <!-- PDFPage:729 -->in paragraph (2) of this subsection may have a financial interest. The Association may join in any such undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called “trusts”; notwithstanding that it is also serving in a fiduciary or representative capacity; and is authorized to guarantee any participations or other instruments, whether evidence of property rights or debt, issued for such financing purposes. Participations or other instruments issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection shall to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amounts of any mortgages and their obligations acquired by the Association under <uscode edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721 of this title</uscode>, pursuant to this subsection, shall not be included in the total amounts set forth in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1721" title="12">section 1721(c) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the limitations provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, one or more trusts may be established as provided in this subsection by each of the following departments or agencies:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Farmers Home Administration of the Department of Agriculture, but only with respect to operating loans, direct farm ownership loans, direct housing loans, and direct soil and water loans. Such trusts may not be established with respect to loans for housing for the elderly under sections 502 and 515(a) of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" range="1472 and 1485(a)" section="1472" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1472 and 1485(a)</uscode>], nor with respect to loans for nonfarm recreational development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Department of Education, but only with respect to loans made by the Secretary of Education for construction of academic facilities, and loans to help finance student loan programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The Small Business Administration.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The head of each such department or agency, hereinafter in this subsection called the “trustor,” is authorized to set aside a part or all of any obligations held by the trustor and subject them to a trust or trusts and, incident thereto, shall guarantee to the trustee timely payment thereof. The trust instrument may provide for the issuance and sale of beneficial interests or participations, by the trustee, in such obligations or in the right to receive interest and principal collections therefrom; and may provide for the substitution or withdrawal of such obligations, or for the substitution of cash for obligations. The trust or trusts shall be exempt from all taxation. The trust instrument may also contain other appropriate provisions in keeping with the purposes of this subsection. The Association shall be named and shall act as trustee of any such trusts and, for the purposes thereof, the title to such obligations shall be deemed to have passed to the Association in trust. The trust instrument shall provide that custody, control, and administration of the obligations shall remain in the trustor subjecting the obligations to the trust, subject to transfer to the trustee in event of default or probable default, as determined by the trustee, in the payment of principal and interest of the beneficial interests or participations. Collections from obligations subject to the trust shall be dealt with as provided in the instrument creating the trust. The trust instrument shall provide that the trustee will promptly pay to the trustor the full net proceeds of any sale of beneficial interests or participations to the extent they are based upon such obligations or collections. Such proceeds shall be dealt with as otherwise provided by law for sales or repayment of such obligations. The effect of both past and future sales of any issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be the same, to the extent of the principal of such issue, as the direct sale with recourse of the obligations subject to the trust. Any trustor creating a trust or trusts hereunder is authorized to purchase, through the facilities of the trustee, outstanding beneficial interests or participations to the extent of the amount of the trustor's responsibility to the trustee on beneficial interests or participations outstanding, and to pay the trustor's proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Association as trustee pursuant to the trust instrument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When any trustor guarantees to the trustee the timely payment of obligations the trustor subjects to a trust pursuant to this subsection, and it becomes necessary for such trustor to meet his responsibilities under such guaranty, the trustor is authorized to fulfill such guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Beneficial interests or participations shall not be issued for the account of any trustor in an aggregate principal amount greater than is authorized with respect to such trustor in an appropriation Act. Any such authorization shall remain available only for the fiscal year for which it is granted and for the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Association, as trustee, is authorized to issue and sell beneficial interests or participations under this subsection, notwithstanding that there may be an insufficiency in aggregate receipts from obligations subject to the related trust to provide for the payment by the trustee (on a timely basis out of current receipts or otherwise) of all interest or principal on such interests or participations (after provision for all costs and expenses incurred by the trustee, fairly prorated among trustors). There are authorized to be appropriated without fiscal year limitation such sums as may be necessary to enable any trustor to pay the trustee such insufficiency as the trustee may require on account of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. Such trustor shall make timely payments to the trustee from such appropriations, subject to and in accord with the trust instrument. In the event that the insufficiency required by the trustee is on account of principal maturities of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, or pursuant hereto, the trustee is authorized to elect to issue additional beneficial interests or participations for refinancing pur<!-- PDFPage:730 -->poses in lieu of requiring any trustor or trustors to make payments to the trustee from appropriated funds or other sources. Each such issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be in an amount determined by the trustee but not in excess of the aggregate amount which the trustee would otherwise require the trustor or trustors to pay from appropriated funds or other sources, and may be issued without regard to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. All refinancing issues of beneficial interests or participations shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the authority contained in the appropriation Act or Acts under which the beneficial interests or participations were originally issued.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Common stock; preferred stock; transferability of shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation shall have common stock, without par value, which shall be vested with all voting rights, each share being entitled to one vote with rights of cumulative voting at all elections of directors. The corporation may eliminate such rights of cumulative voting by a resolution adopted by its board of directors and approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting in person or by proxy at the annual meeting, or other special meeting, at which such resolution is considered. The corporation may have preferred stock on such terms and conditions as the board of directors shall prescribe. The free transferability of the stock at all times to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall not be restricted except that, as to the corporation, it shall be transferable only on the books of the corporation. The corporation may issue shares of common stock in return for appropriate payments into capital or capital and surplus.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fees and charges; annual transfer of earnings to general surplus account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may impose charges or fees, which may be regarded as elements of pricing, with the objective that all costs and expenses of the operations of the corporation should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All earnings from the operations of the corporation shall annually be transferred to the general surplus account of the corporation. At any time, funds of the general surplus account may, in the discretion of the board of directors, be transferred to reserves.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Capital distributions from general surplus account; minimum capitalization levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the corporation may make such capital distributions (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of this title</uscode>) as may be declared by the board of directors. All capital distributions shall be charged against the general surplus account of the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may not make any capital distribution that would decrease the total capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of this title</uscode>) to an amount less than the risk-based capital level for the corporation established under <uscode edition="2006" section="4611" title="12">section 4611 of this title</uscode> or that would decrease the core capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of this title</uscode>) to an amount less than the minimum capital level for the corporation established under <uscode edition="2006" section="4612" title="12">section 4612 of this title</uscode>, without prior written approval of the distribution by the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Institutions eligible to purchase stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any institution, including a national bank or State member bank of the Federal Reserve System or any member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, trust company, or other banking organization, organized under any law of the United States, including the laws relating to the District of Columbia, shall be authorized to purchase shares of common stock of the corporation and to hold or dispose of such stock, subject to the provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purchase and sale of mortgages; secondary market operations; advance of funds or origination of loans; settlement or extinguishment of borrower's rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To carry out the purposes set forth in paragraph (a) <sup><a href="#1719_1_target" name="1719_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="2006" section="1716" title="12">section 1716 of this title</uscode>, the operations of the corporation under this section shall be confined, so far as practicable, to mortgages which are deemed by the corporation to be of such quality, type, and class as to meet, generally, the purchase standards imposed by private institutional mortgage investors. In the interest of assuring sound operation, the prices to be paid by the corporation for mortgages purchased in its secondary market operations under this section, should be established, from time to time, within the range of market prices for the particular class of mortgages involved, as determined by the corporation. The volume of the corporation's purchases and sales, and the establishment of the purchase prices, sale prices, and charges or fees, in its secondary market operations under this section, should be determined by the corporation from time to time, and such determinations should be consistent with the objectives that such purchases and sales should be effected only at such prices and on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the corporation's facilities, and that the operations of the corporation under this section should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the corporation from purchasing, and making commitments to purchase, any mortgage with respect to which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has entered into a contract with the corporation to make interest subsidy payments under section 1715z–8 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The volume of the corporation's lending activities and the establishment of its loan ratios, interest rates, maturities, and charges or fees, in its secondary market operations under this section, should be determined by the corporation from time to time; and such determinations, in conjunction with determinations made under paragraph (1), should be consistent with the objectives that the lending activities should be conducted on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the corporation's facilities, and that the operations of the corporation under this section should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting. The corporation shall not be permitted to use its lending authority (A) to advance funds to a mortgage seller on an interim basis, using mortgage loans as collateral, pending the sale of the mortgages in the secondary market; or (B) to originate mortgage loans. Notwithstanding any Federal, State, or other law to the contrary, the corporation is empowered, in connection with any loan under this section, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the borrower for the settlement or extinguishment, upon default, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the borrower in any mortgage or mortgages that constitute the security for the loan; and with respect to any such loan, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such security shall become the absolute property of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Obligations of the Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the corporation is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and have outstanding at any one time obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be redeemable at the option of the corporation before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation. The corporation is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purchase of obligations by Treasury; conditions and restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in the Secretary's discretion to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as now or hereafter in force, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under <uscode chapter="31" edition="2006" title="31">chapter 31 of title 31</uscode>, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under <uscode chapter="31" edition="2006" title="31">chapter 31 of title 31</uscode> are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of the Secretary's then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $2,250,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current aver<!-- PDFPage:738 -->age rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as the Secretary shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by the Secretary under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage-backed securities; issuance; maturities; rates of interest; exempt securities; adequacy of mortgages to permit principal and interest payments; statement in securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide a greater degree of liquidity to the mortgage investment market and an additional means of financing its operations under this section, the corporation is authorized to set aside any mortgages held by it under this section, and, upon approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue and sell securities based upon the mortgages so set aside. Securities issued under this subsection may be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates of beneficial interest, or both. Securities issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Securities issued by the corporation under this subsection shall, to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mortgages set aside pursuant to this subsection shall at all times be adequate to enable the corporation to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities issued and sold pursuant to this subsection. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of the securities issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such securities, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Subordinated or convertible obligations; issuance; maturities; rate of interest; redemption; exempt securities; debt or obligation of United States; purchases in open market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the corporation is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, obligations which are subordinated to any or all other obligations of the corporation, including subsequent obligations. The obligations issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and may be made redeemable at the option of the corporation before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. Any of such obligations may be made convertible into shares of common stock in such manner, at such price or prices, and at such time or times as may be stipulated therein. Obligations issued by the corporation under this subsection shall, to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States, be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation. The corporation is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on assessment or collection of fee or charge by United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for fees paid pursuant to <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2006" section="1723a" title="12">section 1723a(g) of this title</uscode> and assessments pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="4516" title="12">section 4516 of this title</uscode>, no fee or charge may be assessed or collected by the United States (including any executive department, agency, or independent establishment of the United States) on or with regard to the purchase, acquisition, sale, pledge, issuance, guarantee, or redemption of any mortgage, asset, obligation, trust certificate of beneficial interest, or other security by the corporation. No provision of this subsection shall affect the purchase of any obligation by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of obligations to expedite substitution of private financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section and to assure that, to the maximum extent, and as rapidly as possible, private financing will be substituted for Treasury borrowings otherwise required to carry mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability, the Association is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and have outstanding at any one time obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the Association with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations; but in no event shall any such obligations be issued if, at the time of such proposed issuance, and as a consequence thereof, the resulting aggregate amount of its outstanding obligations under this subsection would exceed the amount of the Association's ownership under the aforesaid separate accountability, free from any liens or encumbrances, of cash, mortgages, and obligations of the United States or guaranteed thereby, or obligations, participations, or other instruments which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust or public funds. The proceeds of any private financing effected under this subsection shall be paid to the Secretary of the Treasury in reduction of the indebtedness of the Association to the Secretary of the Treasury under the aforesaid separate accountability. The Association shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the Association. The Association is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cutoff date as controlling purchases; total amount of mortgages and commitments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be purchased by the Association in its operations under this section except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of a contract or commitment to purchase the same made prior to the cutoff date provided for in section 1718(d) <sup><a href="#1721_1_target" name="1721_1">1</a></sup> of this title, which contract or commitment became a part of the aforesaid separate accountability, and the total amount of mortgages and commitments held by the Association under this section shall not, in any event, exceed $3,350,000,000: <em>Provided</em>, That such maximum amount shall be progressively reduced by the amount of cash realizations on <!-- PDFPage:741 -->account of principal of mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability and by cancellation of any commitments to purchase mortgages thereunder, as reflected by the books of the Association, with the objective that the entire aforesaid maximum amount shall be eliminated with the orderly liquidation of all mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Association from granting such usual and customary increases in the amounts of outstanding commitments (resulting from increased costs or otherwise) as have theretofore been covered by like increases in commitments granted by the agencies of the Federal Government insuring or guaranteeing the mortgages. There shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in this subsection the amounts of any mortgages which, subsequent to May 31, 1954, are transferred by law to the Association and held under the aforesaid separate accountability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of obligations sufficient to carry out functions; character; purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Association may issue to the Secretary of the Treasury its obligations in an amount outstanding at any one time sufficient to enable the Association to carry out its functions under this section, such obligations to mature not more than five years from their respective dates of issue, to be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. Each such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the issuance of the obligation of the Association.

These shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in subsection (c) of this section the amounts of any obligations or mortgages purchased by the Association pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Association is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on such trust certificates or other securities as shall (i) be issued by the corporation under <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2006" section="1719" title="12">section 1719(d) of this title</uscode>, or by any other issuer approved for the purposes of this subsection by the Association, and (ii) be based on and backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages which are insured under this chapter, or which are insured or guaranteed under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1471" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.</uscode>], or <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>, or which are guaranteed under title XIII of the Public Health Service Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="300e" title="42">42 U.S.C. 300e et seq.</uscode>]; <sup><a href="#1721_3_target" name="1721_3">3</a></sup> or guaranteed under section 1715z–13a of this title. The Association shall collect from the issuer a reasonable fee for any guaranty under this subsection and shall make such charges as it may determine to be reasonable for the analysis of any trust or other security arrangement proposed by the issuer. In the event the issuer is unable to make any payment of principal of or interest on any security guaranteed under this subsection, the Association shall make such payment as and when due in cash, and thereupon shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment. In any case in which (I) Federal law requires the reduction of the interest rate on any mortgage backing a security guaranteed under this subsection, (II) the mortgagor under the mortgage is a person in the military service, and (III) the issuer of such security fails to receive from the mortgagor the full amount of interest payment due, the Association may make payments of interest on the security in amounts not exceeding the difference between the amount payable under the interest rate on the mortgage and the amount of interest actually paid by the mortgagor. The Association is hereby empowered, in connection with any guaranty under this subsection, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the issuer for the extinguishment, upon default by the issuer, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the issuer in any mortgage or mortgages constituting the trust or pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued; and with respect to any issue of guaranteed securities, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, <!-- PDFPage:742 -->the mortgages that constitute such trust or pool shall become the absolute property of the Association subject only to the unsatisfied rights of the holders of the securities based on and backed by such trust or pool. No State or local law, and no Federal law (except Federal law enacted expressly in limitation of this subsection after October 8, 1980), shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Association of (A) its power to contract with the issuer on the terms stated in the preceding sentence, (B) its rights to enforce any such contract with the issuer, or (C) its ownership rights, as provided in the preceding sentence, in the mortgages constituting the trust or pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty under this subsection. There shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in subsection (c) of this section the amounts of any mortgages acquired by the Association as a result of its operations under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject only to the absence of qualified requests for guarantees, to the authority provided in this subsection, and to the extent of or in such amounts as any funding limitation approved in appropriation Acts, the Association shall enter into commitments to issue guarantees under this subsection in an aggregate amount of $110,000,000,000 during fiscal year 1996. There are authorized to be appropriated to cover the costs (as such term is defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="661a" title="2">section 661a of title 2</uscode>) of guarantees issued under this chapter by the Association such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No fee or charge in excess of 6 basis points may be assessed or collected by the United States (including any executive department, agency, or independent establishment of the United States) on or with regard to any guaranty of the timely payment of principal or interest on securities or notes based on or backed by mortgages that are secured by 1- to 4-family dwellings and (i) insured by the Federal Housing Administration under subchapter II of this chapter; or (ii) insured or guaranteed under the Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944, <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>, or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [<uscode edition="2006" section="1471" title="42">42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The fees charged for the guaranty of securities or on notes based on or backed by mortgages not referred to in subparagraph (A), as authorized by other provisions of law, shall be set by the Association at a level not more than necessary to create reserves sufficient to meet anticipated claims based upon actuarial analysis, and for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Fees or charges for the issuance of commitments or miscellaneous administrative fees of the Association shall not be on a competitive auction basis and shall remain at the level set for such fees or charges as of September 1, 1985, except that such fees or charges may be increased if reasonably related to the cost of administering the program, and for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Not less than 90 days before increasing any fee or charge under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a certification that such increase is solely for the purpose specified in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (D), fees charged for the guarantee of, or commitment to guarantee, multiclass securities backed by a trust or pool of securities or notes guaranteed by the Association under this subsection, and other related fees shall be charged by the Association in an amount the Association deems appropriate. The Association shall take such action as may be necessary to reasonably assure that such portion of the benefit, resulting from the Association's multiclass securities program, as the Association determines is appropriate accrues to mortgagors who execute eligible mortgages after August 10, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Association shall provide for the initial implementation of the program for which fees are charged under the first sentence of clause (i) by notice published in the Federal Register. The notice shall be effective upon publication and shall provide an opportunity for public comment. Not later than 12 months after publication of the notice, the Association shall issue regulations for such program based on the notice, comments received, and the experience of the Association in carrying out the program during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Association shall consult with persons or entities in such manner as the Association deems appropriate to ensure the efficient commencement and operation of the multiclass securities program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) No State or local law, and no Federal law (except Federal law enacted expressly in limitation of this clause after August 10, 1993) shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Association of its power to contract with persons or entities, and its rights to enforce such contracts, for the purpose of ensuring the efficient commencement and continued operation of the multiclass securities program.</p>

The penalty shall be in addition to any other available civil remedy or any available criminal penalty and may be imposed whether or not the Secretary imposes other administrative sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the penalty, as determined by the Secretary, may not exceed $5,000 for each violation, except that the maximum penalty for all violations by a particular issuer or custodian during any one-year period shall not exceed $1,000,000. Each violation of a provision of subsection (b)(1) of this section shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each pool of mortgages. In the case of a continuing violation, as determined by the Secretary, each day shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Violations for which penalty may be imposed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The violations by an issuer or a custodian for which the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty under subsection (a) of this section are the following:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (a) of this section. The standards and procedures—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall provide for the Secretary to make the determination to impose the penalty;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide for review by the Secretary of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of a notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of a penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Secretary reviews the determination or order, the Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Secretary does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors in determining amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (a) of this section, consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine by regulations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Objections not raised in hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence, which was not presented at such hearing, is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of such additional evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The decisions, findings, and determinations of the Secretary shall be reviewed pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="706" title="5">section 706 of title 5</uscode>.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Action to collect penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any issuer or custodian fails to comply with the Secretary's determination or order imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (a) of this section, after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (c)(1) and (d) of this section, the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in an appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the issuer or custodian and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the discretion of the court, include any attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Settlement by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) “Knowingly” defined</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Intent of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that it has been its intent since the enactment of this chapter that housing built with the aid of mortgages insured under this chapter is to be used principally for residential use; and that this intent excludes the use of such housing for transient or hotel purposes while such insurance on the mortgage remains outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions to prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no new, existing, or rehabilitated multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage is insured under this chapter shall be operated for transient or hotel purposes unless (1) on or before May 28, 1954, the Secretary has agreed in writing to the rental of all or a portion of the accommodations in the project for transient or hotel purposes (in which case no accommodations in excess of the number so agreed to by the Secretary shall be rented on such basis), or (2) the project covered by the insured mortgage is located in an area which the Secretary determines to be a resort area, and the Secretary finds that prior to May 28, 1954, a portion of the accommodations in the project had been made available for rent for transient or hotel purposes (in which case no accommodations in excess of the number which had been made available for such use shall be rented on such basis).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification as to use as requisite for insurance; exceptions to prohibition against insuring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured under this chapter (except pursuant to a commitment to insure issued prior to August 2, 1954), and (except as to housing coming within the provisions of clause (1) or clause (2) of subsection (b) of this section) no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured for an additional term, unless (1) the mortgagor certifies under oath that while such insurance remains outstanding he will not rent, or permit the rental of, such housing or any part thereof for transient or hotel purposes, and (2) the Secretary has entered into such contract with, or purchased such stock of, the mortgagor as the Secretary deems necessary to enable him to prevent or terminate any use of such property or project for transient or hotel purposes while the mortgage insurance remains outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this section by all ap<!-- PDFPage:758 -->propriate means at his disposal, as to all existing multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage was insured under this chapter prior to August 2, 1954, as well as to all multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage is hereafter insured under this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That no criminal penalty shall, by reason of enactment of this section, be applicable to the rental or operation of any such existing multifamily housing in violation of any provision of subsection (b) of this section at any time prior to August 2, 1954.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, (1) the term “rental for transient or hotel purposes” shall have such meaning as prescribed by the Secretary but rental for any period less than thirty days shall in any event constitute rental for such purposes, and (2) the term “multifamily housing” shall mean (i) a property held by a mortgagor upon which there are located five or more single family dwellings, or upon which there is located a two-, three-, or four-family dwelling, or (ii) a property or project covered by mortgage insured or to be insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode>, under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715e" title="12">section 1715e of this title</uscode> with respect to any property or project of a corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) thereof, under <uscode edition="2006" section="1715k" title="12">section 1715k of this title</uscode> if the mortgage is within the provisions of paragraph (3) (B) of subsection (d) thereof, under section 1715<em>l</em> of this title if the mortgage is within the provisions of paragraph (3) of subsection (d) thereof, under <uscode edition="2006" range="1743, 1748b, or 1750g" section="1743" title="12">section 1743, 1748b, or 1750g of this title</uscode>, or (iii) a project with respect to which an insurance contract pursuant to subchapter VII of this chapter is outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Investigation after notice of violation; cease order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Promptly after receipt of written notice that any portion of any building is being rented or operated in violation of any provision of this section or of any rule or regulation lawfully issued thereunder, the Secretary shall investigate the existence of the facts alleged in the written notice and shall order such violation, if found to exist, to cease forthwith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prosecution by Attorney General for continued violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If such violation does not cease in accordance with such order, the Secretary shall forward the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States for prosecution of such civil or criminal action, if any, which the Attorney General may find to be involved in such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Judicial procedure for injunction or other order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever he finds a violation of any provision of this section has occurred or is about to occur, the Attorney General shall petition the district court of the United States or the district court of any Territory or other place subject to United States jurisdiction within whose jurisdictional limits the person doing or committing the acts or practices constituting the alleged violation of this section shall be found, for an order enjoining such acts or practices, and upon a showing by the Attorney General that such acts or practices constituting such violation have been engaged in or are about to be engaged in, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order, with or without such injunction or restraining order, shall be granted without bond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Injunctive relief for hotel owners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person owning or operating a hotel within a radius of fifty miles of a place where a violation of any provision of this section has occurred or is about to occur, or any group or association of hotel owners or operators within said fifty-mile radius, at his or their sole charge or cost, may petition any district court of the United States or the district court or any Territory or other place subject to United States jurisdiction within whose jurisdictional limits the person doing or committing the acts or practices constituting the alleged violation of this section shall be found, for an order enjoining such acts or practices, and, upon a showing that such acts or practices constituting such violation have been engaged in or are about to be engaged in, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order, with or without such injunction or restraining order, shall be granted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Jurisdiction of district courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The several district courts of the United States and the several district courts of the Territories of the United States or other place subject to United States jurisdiction, within whose jurisdictional limits the person doing or committing the acts or practices constituting the alleged violation shall be found, shall, wheresoever such acts or practices may have been done or committed, have full power and jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine such matter under subsections (h) and (i) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized and directed to conduct a full and complete investigation and study and report to Congress, with recommendations, not later than March 1, 1977, with respect to an effective program for protecting home buyers from hidden or undisclosed defects seriously affecting the use and livability of the home, which would be applicable to existing homes financed with mortgages insured under this chapter. In the study and report the Secretary shall particularly investigate the need for, cost and feasible structure of, a national home inspection and warranty program, with respect to such homes, to be operated by the Federal Government out of fees assessed on the home buyer and amortized over a period of two years. The Secretary's report shall also present an analysis of alternative Federal programs to meet these needs, and the cost and means of financing such programs. In the report the Secretary shall also outline administrative steps which can be taken to provide disclosure to purchasers of existing homes financed with mortgages insured under this chapter of the actual condition of the home and the types of repairs or replacements likely to be needed within a period of two years, such as repairs or replacement of furnace, roof or major appliances, based on age and useful life expectancy of such appurtenances.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Periodic review of mortgagee performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To reduce losses in connection with single family mortgage insurance programs under this chapter, at least once a year the Secretary shall review the rate of early defaults and claims for insured single family mortgages originated or underwritten by each mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comparison with other mortgagees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each mortgagee, the Secretary shall compare the rate of early defaults and claims for insured single family mortgage loans originated or underwritten by the mortgagee in an area with the rate of early defaults and claims for other mortgagees originating or underwriting insured single family mortgage loans in the area. For purposes of this section, the term “area” means each geographic area in which the mortgagee is authorized by the Secretary to originate insured single family mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of mortgagee origination approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1708" title="12">section 1708(c) of this title</uscode>, the Secretary may terminate the approval of a mortgagee to originate or underwrite single family mortgages if the Secretary determines that the mortgage loans originated or underwritten by the mortgagee present an unacceptable risk to the insurance funds. The determination shall be based on the comparison required under subsection (b) of this section and shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Secretary. The Secretary may rely on existing regulations published before this section takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall give a mortgagee at least 60 days prior written notice of any termination under this subsection. The termination shall take effect at the end of the notice period, unless the Secretary withdraws the termination notice or extends the notice period. If requested in writing by the mortgagee within 30 days of the date of the notice, the mortgagee shall be entitled to an informal conference with the official authorized to issue termination notices on behalf of the Secretary (or a designee of that official). At the informal conference, the mortgagee may present for consideration specific factors that it believes were beyond its control and that caused the excessive default and claim rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary is requested to accept assignment of a mortgage insured by the Secretary that covers a multifamily housing project (as such term is defined in section 1701z–11(b) of this title) or a health care facility (including a nursing home, intermediate care facility, or board and care home (as those terms are defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1715w" title="12">section 1715w of this title</uscode>), a hospital (as that term is defined in section 1715z–7 of this title), or a group practice facility (as that term is defined in section 1749aaa–5 of this title)) and the Secretary determines that partial payment would be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the low-income character of the project, or for keeping the health care facility operational to serve community needs, the Secretary may request the mortgagee, in lieu of assignment, to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) accept partial payment of the claim under the mortgage insurance contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recast the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existing mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary, in connection with a mortgage restructuring under section 514 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, may make a one time, nondefault partial or full payment of claim under one or more mortgage insurance contracts, which shall include a determination by the Secretary or the participating administrative entity, in accordance with the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, of the market value of the project and a restructuring of the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as are permitted by section 517(a) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition to a partial claim payment under this section, the mortgagor shall agree to repay to the Secretary the amount of such payment and such obligation shall be secured by a second mortgage on the property on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term “mortgage” means a mortgage which (A) is insured under the National Housing Act [<uscode edition="2006" section="1701" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.</uscode>], or (B) secures a home loan guaranteed or insured under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “Federal mortgage agency” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when used in connection with mortgages insured under the National Housing Act, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs when used in connection with mortgages securing home loans guaranteed or insured under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or <uscode chapter="37" edition="2006" title="38">chapter 37 of title 38</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term “distressed mortgagor” means an individual who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was employed by the Federal Government at, or was assigned as a serviceman to, a military base or other Federal installation and whose employment or service at such base or installation was terminated subsequent to November 1, 1964, as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of such base or installation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is the owner-occupant of a dwelling situated at or near such base or installation and upon which there is a mortgage securing a loan which is in default because of the inability of such individual to make payments due under such mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for, issuance and expiration of certificate of moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any distressed mortgagor, for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure of his mortgage, may apply to the appropriate Federal mortgage agency for a determination that suspension of his obligation to make payments due under such mortgage during a temporary period is necessary in order to avoid such foreclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receipt of an application made under this subsection by a distressed mortgagor, the Federal mortgage agency shall issue to such mortgagor a certificate of moratorium if it determines, after consultation with the interested mortgagee, that such action is necessary to avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Prior to the issuance to any distressed mortgagor of a certificate of moratorium under paragraph (2), the Federal mortgage agency, the mortgagor, and the mortgagee shall enter into a binding agreement under which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the mortgagor will be required to make payments to such agency, after the expiration of such certificate, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid by such agency on behalf of such mortgagor as provided in subsection (c) of this section, together with interest thereon at a rate not to exceed the rate provided in the mortgage; the manner and time in which such payments shall be made to be determined by the Federal mortgage agency having due regard for the purposes sought to be achieved by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Federal mortgage agency will be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee to the extent of payments made pursuant to such certificate, which rights, however, shall be subject to the prior right of the mortgagee to receive the full amount payable under the mortgage.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any certificate of moratorium issued under this subsection shall expire on whichever of the following dates is the earliest—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) two years from the date on which such certificate was issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thirty days after the date on which the mortgagor gives notice in writing to the Federal mortgage agency that he is able to resume his obligation to make payments due under his mortgage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) thirty days after the date on which the Federal mortgage agency determines that the mortgagor to whom such certificate was issued has ceased to be a distressed mortgagor as defined in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:780 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to mortgagee of assumption of mortgagor's obligation by agency; amount of payments; suspension of payments by mortgagor; prohibition against further action to enforce or collect payments; liability of mortgagor upon expiration of certificate; notice of expiration of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever a Federal mortgage agency issues a certificate of moratorium to any distressed mortgagor with respect to any mortgage, it shall transmit to the mortgagee a copy of such certificate, together with a notice stating that, while such certificate is in effect, such agency will assume the obligation of such mortgagor to make payments due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments made by any Federal mortgage agency pursuant to a certificate of moratorium issued under this section with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor may include, in addition to the payments referred to in paragraph (1), an amount equal to the unpaid payments under such mortgage prior to the issuance of such certificate, plus a reasonable allowance for foreclosure costs actually paid by the mortgagee if a foreclosure action was dismissed as a result of the issuance of a moratorium certificate. Payments by the Federal mortgage agency may also include payments of taxes and insurance premiums on the mortgaged property as deemed necessary when these items are not provided for through payments to a tax and insurance account held by the interested mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) While any certificate of moratorium issued under this section is in effect with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor, no further payments due under the mortgage shall be required of such mortgagor, and no action (legal or otherwise) shall be taken or maintained by the mortgagee to enforce or collect such payments. Upon the expiration of such certificate, the mortgagor shall again be liable for the payment of all amounts due under the mortgage in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each Federal mortgage agency shall give prompt notice in writing to the interested mortgagor and mortgagee of the expiration of any certificate of moratorium issued by it under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal mortgage agencies are authorized to issue such individual and joint regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section and to insure the uniform administration thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fund for extending financial assistance to distressed mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be in the Treasury (1) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purpose of extending financial assistance in behalf of distressed mortgagors as provided in subsection (c) of this section, and for paying administrative expenses incurred in connection with such assistance, and (2) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the same purpose, except administrative expenses. The capital of each such fund shall consist of such sums as may, from time to time, be appropriated thereto, and any sums so appropriated shall remain available until expended. Receipts arising from the programs of assistance under subsection (c) of this section shall be credited to the funds from which such assistance was extended. Moneys in either of such funds not needed for current operations, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as the case may be, shall be invested in bonds or other obligations of the United States, or paid into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Relief of housing shortage; eligibility; limitations on time and amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage of housing which now exists and to increase the supply of housing accommodations available to veterans of World War II at prices within their reasonable ability to pay, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the in<!-- PDFPage:782 -->suring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed $6,150,000,000 except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased to not to exceed $6,650,000,000: <em>Provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after April 30, 1948, except (A) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before April 30, 1948, or (B) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under this section and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage, and no mortgage shall be insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> after March 1, 1950, except (i) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before March 1, 1950, or (ii) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage: <em>Provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certifications to be filed with the Secretary; and violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall, in his discretion, have power to require the availability for rental purposes of properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter, in such instances and for such periods of time as he may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the first proviso of this subsection, mortgages may be insured under <uscode edition="2006" range="1744 and 1746" section="1744" title="12">sections 1744 and 1746 of this title</uscode> if the aggregate amounts of principal obligations of mortgages insured under said sections plus the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1745" title="12">section 1745 of this title</uscode> do not exceed the limitation contained in said section 1745 upon the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured pursuant to said section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the second proviso of this subsection, mortgages otherwise eligible for insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> may be hereafter insured thereunder if the application for such insurance was received by the Department of Housing and Urban Development on or before March 1, 1950, and for such purpose the aggregate amount of principal obligations authorized to be insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> is increased by not to exceed $500,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), except that as to applications received by the Secretary on or before March 31, 1948, the mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the necessary current cost (including the land and such initial service charges and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve); of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than four families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall in no event, however, exceed—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $5,400 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $7,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) $9,500 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) $12,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence:</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em"><em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may, if he finds that at any time or in any particular geographical area it is not feasible, within such limitations of maximum mortgage amounts, to construct dwellings without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, prescribe by regulation or otherwise higher maximum mortgage amounts not to exceed—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $12,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) $15,750 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) $18,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed twenty-five years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:783 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges; payments; acceptance for insurance; preferences; adjustments and refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the shortage of housing referred to in this section. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure to veterans of World War II, and their immediate families, and to hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1738" title="12">section 1738 of this title</uscode> shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates, and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: <em>Provided further</em>, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50 <sup><a href="#1739_1_target" name="1739_1">1</a></sup> apply and which are insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1738" title="12">section 1738 of this title</uscode> and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for <!-- PDFPage:785 -->any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagee or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagor shall not be released from such liability in any case until the Secretary is satisfied that the mortgaged property has been sold to a purchaser satisfactory to the Secretary, and that such purchaser has paid on account of the purchase price, in cash or its equivalent, at least 10 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the value as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debenture issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964, shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section on or after May 26, 1942, shall mature ten years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section prior to May 26, 1942, shall mature three years after the 1st day of July following the maturity date of the mortgage on the property in exchange for which the debentures were issued: <em>Provided</em>, That any mortgagee entitled to receive such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof debentures which shall mature ten years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, after deducting (in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound accounting practice) the expenses incurred by the Secretary, the net amount realized from any property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and the claims assigned therewith exceed the face value of the debentures issued and the cash paid in exchange for such property plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such cer<!-- PDFPage:786 -->tificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property: <em>Provided</em>, That on and after September 2, 1964, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: <em>Provided</em>, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificate of claim outstanding as of September 2, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With the consent of the holder thereof, the Secretary is authorized to settle, without awaiting the final liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, any certificate of claim issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, with respect to which a settlement had not been effected prior to September 2, 1964, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount, not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after September 2, 1964, in the liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this subchapter; and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this subchapter, except that no suit or action shall be commenced by the Secretary against any such mortgagor on account of any claim so assigned with respect to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1738" title="12">section 1738 of this title</uscode> unless such suit or action is commenced within six months after the assignment of such claim to the Secretary, or within six months after the last payment was made to the Secretary with respect to the claim so assigned, whichever is later: <em>Provided</em>, That <uscode edition="2006" section="5" title="41">section 5 of title 41</uscode> shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have and no certificate of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1743. Insurance of mortgages</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Additional authorization; advances during construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1738" title="12">section 1738 of this title</uscode>, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1736" title="12">section 1736 of this title</uscode> (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance <!-- PDFPage:788 -->Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Preference or priority of opportunity in the occupancy of the mortgaged property for veterans of World War II and their immediate families, and for hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, shall be provided under such regulations and procedures as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed $5,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the necessary current cost of the completed property or project, including the land; the proposed physical improvements; utilities within the boundaries of the property or project; architects’ fees; taxes and interest accruing during construction; and other miscellaneous charges incidental to construction and approved by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That such mortgage shall not in any event exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the cost of the completed physical improvements on the property or project, exclusive of off-site public utilities and streets, and organization and legal expenses: <em>And provided further</em>, That the principal obligation of the mortgage shall not, in any event, exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the replacement cost of the property or project on the basis of the costs prevailing on December 31, 1947, for properties or projects of comparable quality in the locality where such property or project is to be located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed $8,100 per family unit for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payment within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments; default; insurance benefits for mortgagee; value of mortgage; foreclosure of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagors or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1739" title="12">section 1739(c) of this title</uscode>, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation on the date of default; (ii) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (i) hereof, shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certificates of claim; amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this section shall be for an amount determined in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1739" title="12">section 1739 of this title</uscode>, except that any amount remaining after <!-- PDFPage:789 -->the payment of the full amount under the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; date of issuance; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of section 1739 (d) of this title except that such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (c) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of <uscode detail="(k)" edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713(k) of this title</uscode> shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section, except that, as applied to such mortgages, the reference therein to subsection (g) shall be construed to refer to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgages in connection with sale of property under subchapter I, II, VIII, or X of this chapter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have power to insure under this subchapter or subchapter I, II, VIII, or X of this chapter any mortgage executed in connection with the sale by him of any property acquired under any of such subchapters without regard to limitations upon eligibility, time, or aggregate amount contained therein.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1744. Insurance of loans for manufacture of houses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Relief of housing shortage; advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage of housing which now exists and to promote the production of housing for veterans of World War II at moderate prices or rentals within their reasonable ability to pay, through the application of modern industrial processes, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans to finance the manufacture of housing (including advances on such loans) when such loans are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans for the manufacture of houses shall be eligible for insurance under this section if at the time of such insurance, the Secretary determines they meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The manufacturer shall establish that binding purchase contracts have been executed satisfactory to the Secretary providing for the purchase and delivery of the houses to be manufactured, which contracts shall provide for the payment of the purchase price at such time as may be agreed to by the parties thereto, but, in no event, shall the purchase price be payable on a date in excess of thirty days after the date of delivery of such houses, unless not less than 20 per centum of such purchase price is paid on or before the date of delivery and the lender has accepted and discounted or has agreed to accept and discount, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section a promissory note or notes, executed by the purchaser, representing the unpaid portion of such purchase price, in which event such unpaid portion of the purchase price may be payable on a date not in excess of one hundred and eighty days from the date of delivery of such houses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such houses to be manufactured shall meet such requirements of sound quality, durability, livability, and safety as may be prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The borrower shall establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that he has or will have adequate plant facilities, sufficient capital funds, taking into account the loan ap<!-- PDFPage:790 -->plied for, and the experience necessary, to achieve the required production schedule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The loan shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the necessary current cost, exclusive of profit, of manufacturing the houses, which are the subject of such purchase contracts assigned to secure the loan, less any sums paid by the purchaser under said purchase contracts prior to the assignment thereof. The loan shall be secured by an assignment of the aforesaid purchase contracts and of all sums payable thereunder on or after the date of such assignment, with the right in the assignee to proceed against such security in case of default as provided in the assignment, which assignment shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary; and the Secretary may require such other agreements and undertakings to further secure the loan as he may determine, including the right, in case of default or at any time necessary to protect the lender, to compel delivery to the lender of any houses then owned and in the possession of the borrower. The loan shall have a maturity not in excess of one year from the date of the note, except that any such loan may be refinanced and extended in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe for an additional term not to exceed one year, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Release of security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the property assigned or delivered as security for the loan, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the security documents may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments; default; insurance benefits for mortgagee; prerequisites; value of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the borrower to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a loan under this section, or the failure to perform any other covenant or obligation contained in any assignment, agreement, or undertaking executed by the borrower in connection with such loan, shall be considered as a default under this section, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance hereinafter provided upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary within a period and in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising with respect to the loan so in default; (2) all claims of the lender against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction; (3) any cash or property held by the lender, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the borrower and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the loan; and (4) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the loan transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2006" section="1739" title="12">section 1739(c) of this title</uscode>, issue to the lender debentures having a face value equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; date of issuance; interest</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to and be held by a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cover property, held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary, upon which there is to be constructed or erected dwelling units for not less than twenty-five families consisting of a group of single-family dwellings approved by the Secretary for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction: <em>Provided</em>, That during the course of construction there may be located upon the mortgaged property a plant for the fabrication or storage of such dwellings or sections or parts thereof, and the Secretary may consent to the removal or release of such plant from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may approve;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the insurance of advances during construction, the Secretary is authorized to approve advances by the mortgagee to cover the cost of materials delivered upon the mortgaged property and labor performed in the fabrication or erection thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may prescribe by regulation a higher maximum rate of interest, not exceeding 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time, if he finds that the mortgage market demands it.

Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section with the mortgagor being either the builder who constructed the dwellings or the owner and occupant of the dwelling at the time, and where the mortgagor is the owner and occupant, may involve a principal obligation in such amount and have such maturity and interest rate as a mortgage eligible for insurance under <uscode detail="(b)(2)(D)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b)(2)(D) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preferences in occupancy for veterans and hardship cases</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acquisition of project by Secretary; issuance of debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the aggregate of the amounts paid to the investor pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1747f" title="12">section 1747f of this title</uscode> with respect to a project insured under this subchapter shall at any time equal or exceed 15 per centum of the established investment, the Secretary thereafter shall have the right, after written notice to the investor of his intentions so to do, to acquire, as of the first day of any operating year, such project in consideration of the issuance and delivery to the investor of debentures having a total face value equal to 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for such operating year. In any such case the investor shall be obligated to convey to said Secretary title to the project which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the insurance contract was executed and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and, in the event that the investor fails so to do, said Secretary may, at his option, terminate the insurance contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relinquishment of project by investor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If in any operating year the aggregate of the differences between the operating expenses (exclusive of any premium charges previously waived hereunder) and the gross income for the preceding operating years, less the aggregate of any deficits in such operating expenses reimbursed from excess earnings as hereinbefore provided, shall at any time equal or exceed 5 per centum of the established investment, the investor shall thereafter have the right, after written notice to the Secretary of his intention so to do, to convey to the Secretary, as of the first day of any operating year, title to the project which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the insurance contract was executed and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and to receive from the Secretary debentures having a total face value equal to 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for such operating year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustment of difference between outstanding investment and total face value of debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any difference, not exceeding $50, between 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for the operating year in which a project is acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this section and the total face value of the debentures to be issued and delivered to the investment pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the investor from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination of insurance contract by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the acquisition of a project by the Secretary pursuant to this section, the insurance contract shall terminate.</p>

Such debentures shall be dated as of the first day of the operating year in which the project for which such debentures were issued was acquired by the Secretary, shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, with the <!-- PDFPage:797 -->approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the insurance contract was executed, but not to exceed 23/4 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature on the 1st day of July in such calendar year or years, not later than the fortieth following the date of the issuance thereof, as shall be determined by the Secretary and stated on the face of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms and conditions of debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such debentures shall be in such form and in such denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and may include such provisions of redemption as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be issued in either coupon or registered form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exemption from taxation; exceptions; guaranty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, shall be payable out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, as to both the principal thereof and the interest thereon, by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face thereof. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or the interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof, which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Payment of expenses and charges; collection of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real and other property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, to pay out of said Fund all expenses or charges in connection with, and to deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit or lease in his discretion, in whole or in part, any project acquired pursuant to this subchapter; and, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection by way of compromise or otherwise all claims acquired by, or assigned or transferred to, him in connection with the acquisition or disposal of any project pursuant to this subchapter: <em>Provided</em>, That <uscode edition="2006" section="5" title="41">section 5 of title 41</uscode> shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of any project acquired pursuant to this subchapter if the amount of such purchase or contract does not exceed $1,000.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aggregate amount of insurance; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage and urgent need for family housing which now exists at or in areas adjacent to military installations because of uncertainty as to the permanency of such installations and to increase the supply of necessary family housing accommodations for personnel at such installations, the Secretary is authorized, upon application of the mortgagee, to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for so insuring such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter (except mortgages insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to August 11, 1955) shall not exceed $2,300,000,000: <em>And provided further</em>, That the limitation in <uscode edition="2006" section="1715h" title="12">section 1715h of this title</uscode> shall not apply to this subchapter: <em>And provided further</em>, That no more mortgages shall be insured under this section after October 1, 1962, except pursuant to a commitment to insure before such date, and not more than twenty-eight thousand family housing units shall be contracted for after June 30, 1959, pursuant to any mortgage insured under this section after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this subchapter a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to capital structure, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, <!-- PDFPage:801 -->and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in, any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgaged property shall be designed for use for residential purposes by personnel of the armed services and situated at or near a military installation, and the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified that there is no intention, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, to substantially curtail the personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation, and (i) shall have determined that for reasons of safety, security, or other essential military requirements, it is necessary that the personnel involved reside in public quarters: <em>Provided, however</em>, That for the purposes of this subsection housing covered by a mortgage insured, or for which a commitment to insure has been issued, under this section prior to August 11, 1955, may be considered the same as available quarters, and (ii) with the approval of the Secretary, shall have determined that adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distance of the installation and that the mortgaged property will not, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, substantially curtail occupancy in existing housing covered by mortgages insured under this chapter. The housing accommodations shall comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of such property for mortgage insurance, except that the certification of the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall (for purposes of mortgage insurance under this subchapter) be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the existence of the need for such housing. However, if the Secretary does not concur in the housing needs as certified by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund against loss with respect to the mortgage covering such housing. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the cost of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the cost of the land, the physical improvements, and utilities within the boundaries of the property or project);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit for such part of such property or project (including ranges, refrigerators, shades, screens, and fixtures) as may be attributable to dwelling use: <em>Provided</em>, That the replacement cost of the property or project as determined by the Secretary, including the estimated value of any usable utilities within the boundaries of the property or project where owned by the United States and not provided for out of the proceeds of the mortgage, shall not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <em>Provided further</em>, That should the financing of housing to be constructed pursuant to a single invitation for bids be accomplished by two or more mortgages, the principal obligation of any single mortgage may exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit if the sum of the principal obligations of all mortgages for such housing does not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <em>And provided further</em>, That subject to the limitations of this paragraph no family unit included in any mortgaged property shall be contracted for after June 8, 1960 if the cost of such unit exceeds $19,800; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed the bid of the eligible bidder with respect to the property or project under <uscode edition="2006" section="1594" title="42">section 1594 of title 42</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, but not to exceed thirty years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. The property or project may include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this sub<!-- PDFPage:802 -->chapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary may reduce the payment of premiums provided for herein. The Secretary is further authorized to reduce the amount of the premium charge below one-half of 1 per centum per annum with respect to any mortgage on property acquired by the Secretary of Defense or his designee if the mortgage is insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter as in effect prior to August 11, 1955.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Default by mortgagor; rights of mortgagee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this subchapter shall be considered a default under such mortgage, and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (e) of this section, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (ii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; issuance; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $50, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Debentures; execution; signature; negotiability; interest rate; tax exemption; guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof.

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter and in addition to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1748b" title="12">section 1748b of this title</uscode>, the Secretary may insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements set forth in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b) of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage insured under this section shall have been executed by a mortgagor who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of a change in his employment by the Armed Forces or a contractor thereof and to whom the Secretary of Defense or his designee has issued a certificate indicating that such person requires housing and is at the date of the certificate a civilian employee at a research or development installation of one of the military departments of the United States or a contractor thereof and is considered by such military department to be an essential, nontemporary employee at such date. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the employment status of the mortgagor and of the mortgagor's need for housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of housing need to Secretary; guaranty from loss; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified to the Secretary that the housing is necessary to provide adequate housing for such civilians employed in connection with such a research or development installation and that there is no present intention to substantially curtail the number of such civilian personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a) of this section, if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economic soundness of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter, that the project or property be economically sound or an acceptable risk.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rental conditions; preferences and priorities in the sale or rental of dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require each project covered by a mortgage insured under this section to be held for rental for a period of not less than five years after the project or dwelling is made available for initial occupancy or until he finds that the housing may be released from such rental condition. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure reasonable preference or priority in the sale or rental of dwellings covered by a mortgage insured under this section for military personnel and essential civilian employees of the armed services, employees of contractors for the armed services, and persons described in clause (1)(B) of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property held by mortgagor approved by Secretary; acquisition of stock or interest; redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of providing multifamily rental housing projects or housing projects consisting of individual single-family dwellings for sale, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. Any such mortgagor shall possess powers necessary therefor and incidental thereto and shall until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under such insurance be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in, any such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mortgage limitations for multifamily rental property or project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage on any multifamily rental property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed, for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use, $9,000 per family unit without a bedroom, $12,500 per family unit with one bedroom, $15,000 per family unit with two bedrooms, and $18,500 per family unit with three or more bedrooms, and not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project when the proposed physical improvements are completed. The Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations contained in this paragraph by not to exceed 45 per centum in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgage limitation for property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed a sum computed on the basis of a separate mortgage for each single-family dwelling (irrespective of whether such dwelling has a party wall or is otherwise physically connected with another dwelling or dwellings) comprising the property or project equal to the total of each of the maximum principal obligations of such mortgages which would meet the requirements of <uscode detail="(b)(2)" edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709(b)(2) of this title</uscode> if the mortgagor were the owner and occupant who had made the required payment on account of the property prescribed in such paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:809 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amortization; interest; release of part of mortgaged property from lien; replacement of certain mortgages by individual mortgages; commercial and community facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage insured under this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed the maximum term applicable to mortgages under <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, except that individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project may have a term not in excess of the maximum term applicable to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> or the unexpired term of the project mortgage at the time of the release of the mortgaged property from such project mortgage, whichever is the greater, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release, and a mortgage of the character described in subsection (g) of this section may provide that, at any time after the release of the project from the rental period prescribed by subsection (d) of this section, such mortgage may be replaced, in whole or in part, by individual mortgages covering each individual dwelling in the project in amounts not to exceed the unpaid balance of the blanket mortgage allocable to the individual property. Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section. Property covered by a mortgage insured under this section may include eight or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Limitation on aggregate number of dwelling units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of dwelling units (including all units in multifamily projects or individual dwellings) covered by outstanding commitments to insure and mortgages insured under this section shall at no time exceed five thousand dwelling units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (<em>l</em>), and (n) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode> shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section except individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project, and as to such individual mortgages the provisions of subsections (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),<sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> (j), and (k) <sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode> shall be applicable: <em>Provided</em>, That wherever the words “Fund” or “Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund” appear in <uscode edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710 of this title</uscode>, such reference shall refer to the General Insurance Fund with respect to mortgages insured under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make payments in lieu of taxes on any real property to which title has been or is hereafter acquired by him in fee under <uscode edition="2006" section="1748b" title="12">section 1748b of this title</uscode> as effective prior to August 11, 1955, and on which taxes or payments in lieu of such taxes were payable or paid prior to acquisition by the Secretary. Such payments may be made in connection with tax years occurring prior to or subsequent to October 5, 1962. The amount of any such payments shall not exceed taxes on similar property and shall not include interest or penalties. If the Secretary has acquired or hereafter acquires title in fee to real property by foreclosure or by transfer from some other department or agency of the Government or otherwise during a tax year, he may make a payment in lieu of taxes prorated for that portion of the year remaining after his acquisition of title. This subsection shall not authorize any lien against property held by the Secretary, nor the payment of any tax, nor any payment in lieu of any tax, on any interest of the Secretary as lessee or mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt any real property which has been or is hereafter acquired and held by the Secretary under section 1748h–1 or 1748h–2 of this title from taxation by any State or political subdivision thereof, to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed.</p>

No mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the applicant would be unable to obtain the mortgage loan without such insurance on terms comparable to those specified in subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall fix premium charges for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter, but such charges shall not be more than 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. In addition to the premium charge, the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the analysis of a proposed project and the appraisal and inspection of the property and improvements. Where the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge. This charge shall be in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until the maturity date. Where such prepayment occurs, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Premium charges fixed under this section shall be payable by the mortgagee either in cash, or in debentures which are the obligation of the General Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this section or <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode> as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the property covered by the mortgage is in an area which the President, pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1591" title="42">section 1591 of title 42</uscode>, shall have determined to be a critical defense housing area, and that the total number of dwelling units in properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter in any such area does not exceed the number authorized by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from time to time as needed in such area for defense purposes and to be insured pursuant to this subchapter: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the event the Secretary has issued a commitment to insure a mortgage under this section, which commitment was in force and effect on June 1, 1953, and the Secretary determines that, because of changes in defense requirements, there is reasonable doubt that such housing is needed for defense purposes and that it is probable that the mortgage would become immediately in default and claim made for payment under the mortgage insurance contract if the unit or units are completed and the mortgage insured, the Secretary is authorized, in the interest of conserving the General Insurance Fund, to pay (in cash from the General Insurance Fund) to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor such amount as the Secretary shall determine to be necessary to reimburse the mortgagor the amounts paid or to be paid by the mortgagor on account of labor performed and materials in place, less the Secretary's estimate of the reasonable salvage value of such materials, plus an allowance for development costs equal to 4 per centum of the principal amount of the mortgage specified in such commitment, and no payments shall be made pursuant to this proviso unless a claim therefor is filed not later than six months from date of the determination of lack of need and the claim is in such form and contains such supporting information, documents, and data as the Secretary may require: <em>Provided further</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed such sum as may be authorized by the President from time to time for the purposes of this subchapter pursuant to his <!-- PDFPage:820 -->authority under section 1715h <sup><a href="#1750b_1_target" name="1750b_1">1</a></sup> of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall have power to require properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter to be held for rental for such periods of time and at such rentals or other charges as he may prescribe; and, with respect to such properties being held for rental, (1) to require that the property be held by a mortgagor approved by him, and (2) to prescribe such requirements as he deems to be reasonable governing the method of operation and prohibiting or restricting sales of such properties or interests therein or agreements relating to such sales: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall require each dwelling covered by a mortgage insured under this section, for which a commitment to insure is issued after August 2, 1954, to be held for rental for a period of not less than three years after the dwelling is made available for initial occupancy: <em>And provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for any property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the appraised value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance) of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than two families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, the construction of which is begun after September 1, 1951. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall not, however, exceed $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or $15,000 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence except that the Secretary may by regulation increase these amounts to not to exceed $9,000 and $16,000, respectively, in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary finds that it is not feasible within the aforesaid dollar amount limitations to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms per family unit without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $1,080 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Secretary) in excess of two contained in such family unit if he finds that such unit meets sound standards of livability as a three-bedroom or a four-bedroom unit as the case may be;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges; payments; needs of national defense as prerequisite; adjustments and refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter  unless  the  Secretary  finds  that  the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the needs of national defense. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount <!-- PDFPage:821 -->of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage has continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Upon application of the mortgagee with the consent of the mortgagor of a mortgage for which a commitment to insure has been issued pursuant to <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> covering property on which the construction of the dwellings thereon was begun prior to the enactment of this subchapter and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality in accordance with <uscode edition="2006" section="1715c" title="12">section 1715c of this title</uscode>, the Secretary is authorized, notwithstanding such beginning of construction, to convert such commitment to a commitment under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode>; any charges or fees paid to the Secretary with respect to such insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1709" title="12">section 1709 of this title</uscode> shall be credited to charges or fees due the Secretary with respect to such insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode>; and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality for purposes of <uscode edition="2006" section="1715c" title="12">section 1715c of this title</uscode> may be made by the Secretary of Labor at any time prior to the insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode>: <em>Provided</em>, That such mortgage, or the mortgage covering the same property executed in substitution therefor, is otherwise eligible for insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preference or priority in purchasing or renting properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or any other Act, except provisions of law enacted hereafter expressly referring to this subsection (d), the Secretary is further authorized to prescribe such procedures as are necessary to secure to persons engaged or to be engaged in national defense activities preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties, or interests therein, covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750b" title="12">section 1750b of this title</uscode> shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which be<!-- PDFPage:822 -->come liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: <em>Provided further</em>, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50,<sup><a href="#1750c_1_target" name="1750c_1">1</a></sup> apply and which are insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750b" title="12">section 1750b of this title</uscode>, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagee or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the amount of debentures to which the mortgagee is entitled under this section or <uscode edition="2006" section="1750g" title="12">section 1750g of this title</uscode> and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debentures issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, or gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee under this section shall be for an amount determined in accordance with, and shall contain provisions and shall be paid in accordance with, the provisions of section 1710(e) and <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2006" section="1710" title="12">section 1710(f) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal <!-- PDFPage:823 -->of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this section; and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this subchapter: <em>Provided</em>, That <uscode edition="2006" section="5" title="41">section 5 of title 41</uscode> shall not be construed to apply to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have, and no certification of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under <uscode edition="2006" section="1750b" title="12">section 1750b of this title</uscode>, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in <uscode edition="2006" section="1750" title="12">section 1750 of this title</uscode> (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility  requirements;  release  of  part  of  property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed $5,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed: <em>Provided</em>, That such mortgage shall not in any event exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the cost of the completed physical improvements on the property or project exclusive of off-site public utilities and streets and organization and legal expenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed $8,100 per family unit (or $7,200 per family unit if the number of rooms in such property or project does not equal or exceed four per family unit) for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may by regulation increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $900 in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgagor shall enter into the agreement required by <uscode edition="2006" section="1715r" title="12">section 1715r of this title</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Default; debentures; cash adjustment; certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgagee shall be entitled to receive debentures in connection with mortgages insured under this section in the amount and under the conditions specified in subsection (g) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713 of this title</uscode>, and the references in said subsection (g) to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (j) of section 1713 and to the certificate of claim provided for in subsection (h) of section 1713 shall be deemed to refer respectively to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (c) of <uscode edition="2006" section="1750c" title="12">section 1750c of this title</uscode> and to the certificate of claim provided for in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certificate of claim; contents and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee under this section shall be for an amount determined in accordance with, and shall contain provisions and shall be paid in accordance with, the provisions of <uscode detail="(h)" edition="2006" section="1713" title="12">section 1713(h) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; issuance and payment in accordance with <uscode detail="(c), (d)" edition="2006" section="1750c" title="12">section 1750c(c), (d) of this title</uscode></h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of section 1750c(c) and (d) of this title except that such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (c) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicability of section 1713(k), (<em>l</em>) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 1713(k) and (<em>l</em>) of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section and to property acquired by the Secretary hereunder, except that, as applied to such mortgages and property, the reference therein to subsection (g) shall be construed to refer to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applications under section 1743; credit for fees upon reapplication under this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where an application for insurance under <uscode edition="2006" section="1743" title="12">section 1743 of this title</uscode> was received by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on or before March 1, 1950, and has not been rejected or committed upon, the mortgagee upon reapplication for insurance of a mortgage under this section with respect to the same property shall receive credit for any application fees paid in connection with the prior application: <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not constitute a waiver of any requirements otherwise applicable to the insurance of mortgages under this section.</p>
