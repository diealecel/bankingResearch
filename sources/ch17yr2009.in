<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection, “bank holding company” means any company which has control over any bank or over any company that is or becomes a bank holding company by virtue of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any company has control over a bank or over any company if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the company directly or indirectly or acting through one or more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 per centum or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the company controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or company; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Board determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or company.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of any proceeding under paragraph (2)(C) of this subsection, there is a presumption that any company which directly or indirectly owns, controls, or has power to vote less than 5 per centum of any class of voting securities of a given bank or company does not have control over that bank or company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any administrative or judicial proceeding under this chapter, other than a proceeding under paragraph (2)(C) of this subsection, a company may not be held to have had control over any given bank or company at any given time unless that company, at the time in question, directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or had power to vote 5 per centum or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or company, or had already been found to have control in a proceeding under paragraph (2)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) No bank and no company owning or controlling voting shares of a bank is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership or control of shares in a fiduciary capacity, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (g) of this section. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, bank shares shall not be deemed to have been acquired in a fiduciary capacity if the acquiring bank or company has sole discretionary authority to exercise voting rights with respect thereto; except that this limitation is applicable in the case of a bank or company acquiring such shares prior to December 31, 1970, only if the bank or company has the right consistent with its obligations under the instrument, agreement, or other arrangement establishing the fiduciary relationship to divest itself of such voting rights and fails to exercise that right to divest within a reasonable period not to exceed one year after December 31, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) No company is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership or control of shares acquired by it in connection with its underwriting of securities if such shares are held only for such period of time as will permit the sale thereof on a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No company formed for the sole purpose of participating in a proxy solicitation is a bank holding company by virtue of its control of voting rights of shares acquired in the course of such solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) No company is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership or control of shares <!-- PDFPage:1188 -->acquired in securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith, until two years after the date of acquisition. The Board is authorized upon application by a company to extend, from time to time for not more than one year at a time, the two-year period referred to herein for disposing of any shares acquired by a company in the regular course of securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith, if, in the Board's judgment, such an extension would not be detrimental to the public interest, but no such extension shall in the aggregate exceed three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) No company is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership or control of any State-chartered bank or trust company which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is wholly owned by 1 or more thrift institutions or savings banks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is restricted to accepting—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) deposits from thrift institutions or savings banks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) deposits arising out of the corporate business of the thrift institutions or savings banks that own the bank or trust company; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prior approval of Board as necessary; exceptions; disposition, time extension; subsequent approval or disposition upon disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful, except with the prior approval of the Board, (1) for any action to be taken that causes any company to become a bank holding company; (2) for any action to be taken that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of a bank holding company; (3) for any bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 per centum of the voting shares of such bank; (4) for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof, other than a bank, to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; or (5) for any bank holding company to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. Notwithstanding the foregoing this prohibition shall not apply to (A) shares acquired by a bank, (i) in good faith in a fiduciary capacity, except where such shares are held under a trust that constitutes a company as defined in <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2009" section="1841" title="12">section 1841(b) of this title</uscode> and except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2009" section="1841" title="12">section 1841(g) of this title</uscode>, or (ii) in the regular course of securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith, but any shares acquired after May 9, 1956, in securing or collecting any such previously contracted debt shall be disposed of within a period of two years from the date on which they were acquired; (B) additional shares acquired by a bank holding company in a bank in which such bank holding company owned or controlled a majority of the voting shares prior to such acquisition; or (C) the acquisition, by a company, of control of a bank in a reorganization in which a person or group of persons exchanges their shares of the bank for shares of a newly formed bank holding company and receives after the reorganization substantially the same proportional share interest in the holding company as they held in the bank except for changes in shareholders’ interests resulting from the exercise of dissenting shareholders’ rights under State or Federal law if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) immediately following the acquisition—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the bank holding company meets the capital and other financial standards prescribed by the Board by regulation for such a bank holding company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the bank is adequately capitalized (as defined in section 1831<em>o</em> of this title);</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the holding company does not engage in any activities other than those of managing <!-- PDFPage:1195 -->and controlling banks as a result of the reorganization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the company provides 30 days prior notice to the Board and the Board does not object to such transaction during such 30-day period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the holding company will not acquire control of any additional bank as a result of the reorganization..<sup><a href="#1842_1_target" name="1842_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Board is authorized upon application by a bank to extend, from time to time for not more than one year at a time, the two-year period referred to above for disposing of any shares acquired by a bank in the regular course of securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith, if, in the Board's judgment, such an extension would not be detrimental to the public interest, but no such extension shall in the aggregate exceed three years. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, bank shares acquired after December 31, 1970, shall not be deemed to have been acquired in good faith in a fiduciary capacity if the acquiring bank or company has sole discretionary authority to exercise voting rights with respect thereto, but in such instances acquisitions may be made without prior approval of the Board if the Board, upon application filed within ninety days after the shares are acquired, approves retention or, if retention is disapproved, the acquiring bank disposes of the shares or its sole discretionary voting rights within two years after issuance of the order of disapproval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for approval; notice to Comptroller of Currency or State authority; views and recommendations; disapproval; hearing; order of Board; nonaction deemed grant of application; procedure in emergencies or probable failures requiring immediate Board action and orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice and hearing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving from a company any application for approval under this section, the Board shall give notice to the Comptroller of the Currency, if the applicant company or any bank the voting shares or assets of which are sought to be required <sup><a href="#1842_2_target" name="1842_2">2</a></sup> is a national banking association, or to the appropriate supervisory authority of the interested State, if the applicant company or any bank the voting shares or assets of which are sought to be acquired is a State bank, in order to provide for the submission of the views and recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority, as the case may be. The views and recommendations shall be submitted within thirty calendar days of the date on which notice is given, or within ten calendar days of such date if the Board advises the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action. If the thirty-day notice period applies and if the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority so notified by the Board disapproves the application in writing within this period, the Board shall forthwith give written notice of that fact to the applicant. Within three days after giving such notice to the applicant, the Board shall notify in writing the applicant and the disapproving authority of the date for commencement of a hearing by it on such application. Any such hearing shall be commenced not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the Board has given written notice to the applicant of the action of the disapproving authority. The length of any such hearing shall be determined by the Board, but it shall afford all interested parties a reasonable opportunity to testify at such hearing. At the conclusion thereof, the Board shall, by order, grant or deny the application on the basis of the record made at such hearing. In the event of the failure of the Board to act on any application for approval under this section within the ninety-one-day period which begins on the date of submission to the Board of the complete record on that application, the application shall be deemed to have been granted. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the Board finds that it must act immediately on any application for approval under this section in order to prevent the probable failure of a bank or bank holding company involved in a proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction, the Board may dispense with the notice requirements of this subsection, and if notice is given, the Board may request that the views and recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority, as the case may be, be submitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to the Board. If the Board has found pursuant to this subsection either that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action or that it must act immediately to prevent probable failure, the Board may grant or deny any such application without a hearing notwithstanding any recommended disapproval by the appropriate supervisory authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver in case of bank in danger of closing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board receives a certification described in section 1823(f)(8)(D) <sup><a href="#1842_3_target" name="1842_3">3</a></sup> of this title from the appropriate Federal or State chartering authority that a bank is in danger of closing, the Board may dispense with the notice and hearing requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to any application received by the Board relating to the acquisition of such bank, the bank holding company which controls such bank, or any other affiliated bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors for consideration by Board</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competitive factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall not approve—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any acquisition or merger or consolidation under this section which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other proposed acquisition or merger or consolidation under this section <!-- PDFPage:1196 -->whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint or <sup><a href="#1842_4_target" name="1842_4">4</a></sup> trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Banking and community factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In every case, the Board shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company or companies and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supervisory factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall disapprove any application under this section by any company if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the company fails to provide the Board with adequate assurances that the company will make available to the Board such information on the operations or activities of the company, and any affiliate of the company, as the Board determines to be appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an application involving a foreign bank, the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the bank's home country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain bank stock loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board shall not follow any practice or policy in the consideration of any application for the formation of a one-bank holding company if following such practice or policy would result in the rejection of such application solely because the transaction to form such one-bank holding company involves a bank stock loan which is for a period of not more than twenty-five years. The previous sentence shall not be construed to prohibit the Board from rejecting any application solely because the other financial arrangements are considered unsatisfactory. The Board shall consider transactions involving bank stock loans for the formation of a one-bank holding company having a maturity of twelve years or more on a case by case basis and no such transaction shall be approved if the Board believes the safety or soundness of the bank may be jeopardized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Managerial resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consideration of the managerial resources of a company or bank under paragraph (2) shall include consideration of the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the company or bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Money laundering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In every case, the Board shall take into consideration the effectiveness of the company or companies in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interstate banking</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approvals authorized</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Acquisition of banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may approve an application under this section by a bank holding company that is adequately capitalized and adequately managed to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a State other than the home State of such bank holding company, without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under the law of any State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Preservation of State age laws</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may not approve an application pursuant to such subparagraph that would have the effect of permitting an out-of-State bank holding company to acquire a bank in a host State that has not been in existence for the minimum period of time, if any, specified in the statutory law of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rule for State age laws specifying a period of more than 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding clause (i), the Board may approve, pursuant to subparagraph (A), the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence for at least 5 years without regard to any longer minimum period of time specified in a statutory law of the host State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Shell banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, a bank that has been chartered solely for the purpose of, and does not open for business prior to, acquiring control of, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of, an existing bank shall be deemed to have been in existence for the same period of time as the bank to be acquired.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Effect on State contingency laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the applicability of a State law that makes an acquisition of a bank contingent upon a requirement to hold a portion of such bank's assets available for call by a State-sponsored housing entity established pursuant to State law, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State law does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or bank holding companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that State law was in effect as of September 29, 1994;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has not determined that compliance with such State law would result in an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the appropriate Federal banking agency for such bank has not found that compliance with such State law would place the bank in an unsafe or unsound condition.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1197 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Concentration limits</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nationwide concentration limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may not approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) if the applicant (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the applicant) controls, or upon consummation of the acquisition for which such application is filed would control, more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Statewide concentration limits other than with respect to initial entries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may not approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the applicant (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the applicant), upon consummation of the acquisition, would control 30 percent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in any such State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effectiveness of State deposit caps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the authority of any State to limit, by statute, regulation, or order, the percentage of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the State which may be held or controlled by any bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to the extent the application of such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Exceptions to subparagraph (B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) without regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with respect to any State if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a limitation described in subparagraph (C) in a State statute, regulation, or order which has the effect of permitting a bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to control a greater percentage of total deposits of all insured depository institutions in the State than the percentage permitted under subparagraph (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the acquisition is approved by the appropriate State bank supervisor of such State and the standard on which such approval is based does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) “Deposit” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term “deposit” has the same meaning as in section 1813(<em>l</em>) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ownership or control of voting shares of any company not a bank; engagement in activities other than banking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no bank holding company shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after May 9, 1956, acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after two years from the date as of which it becomes a bank holding company, or in the case of a company which has been continuously affiliated since May 15, 1955, with a company which was registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [<uscode edition="2009" section="80a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 80a</uscode>–1 et seq.], prior to May 15, 1955, in such a manner as to constitute an affiliated company within the meaning of that Act, after December 31, 1978, or, in the case of any company which becomes, as a result of the enactment of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970, a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, after December 31, 1980, retain direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company or engage in any activities other than (A) those of banking or of managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under this chapter or of furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and (B) those permitted under paragraph (8) of subsection (c) of this section subject to all the conditions specified in such paragraph or in any order or regulation issued by the Board under such paragraph: <em>Provided</em>, That a company covered in 1970 may also engage in those activities in which directly or through a subsidiary (i) it was lawfully engaged on June 30, 1968 (or on a date subsequent to June 30, 1968 in the case of activities carried on as the result of the acquisition by such company or subsidiary, pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before June 30, 1968, of another company engaged in such activities at the time of the acquisition), and (ii) it has been continuously engaged since June 30, 1968 (or such subsequent date). The Board by order, after opportunity for hearing, may terminate the authority conferred by the preceding proviso on any company to engage directly or through a subsidiary in any activity otherwise permitted by that proviso if it determines, having due regard to the purposes of this chapter, that such action is necessary to prevent undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices; and in the case of any such <!-- PDFPage:1200 -->company controlling a bank having bank assets in excess of $60,000,000 on or after December 31, 1970, the Board shall determine, within two years after such date (or, if later, within two years after the date on which the bank assets first exceed $60,000,000), whether the authority conferred by the preceding proviso with respect to such company should be terminated as provided in this sentence. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize any bank holding company referred to in the preceding proviso, or any subsidiary thereof, to engage in activities authorized by that proviso through the acquisition, pursuant to a contract entered into after June 30, 1968, of any interest in or the assets of a going concern engaged in such activities. Any company which is authorized to engage in any activity pursuant to the preceding proviso or subsection (d) of this section but, as a result of action of the Board, is required to terminate such activity may (notwithstanding any otherwise applicable time limit prescribed in this paragraph) retain the ownership or control of shares in any company carrying on such activity for a period of ten years from the date on which its authority was so terminated by the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, if any company that became a bank holding company as a result of the enactment of the Competitive Equality Amendments of 1987 acquired, between March 5, 1987, and August 10, 1987, an institution that became a bank as a result of the enactment of such Amendments, that company shall, upon enactment of such Amendments, immediately come into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Board is authorized, upon application by a bank holding company, to extend the two year period referred to in paragraph (2) above from time to time as to such bank holding company for not more than one year at a time, if, in its judgment, such an extension would not be detrimental to the public interest, but no such extensions shall in the aggregate exceed three years. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the period ending December 31, 1980, referred to in paragraph (2) above, may be extended by the Board of Governors to December 31, 1984, but only for the divestiture by a bank holding company of real estate or interests in real estate lawfully acquired for investment or development. In making its decision whether to grant such extension, the Board shall consider whether the company has made a good faith effort to divest such interests and whether such extension is necessary to avert substantial loss to the company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement purporting to represent shares of any company except a bank or bank holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After two years from May 9, 1956, no certificate evidencing shares of any bank holding company shall bear any statement purporting to represent shares of any other company except a bank or a bank holding company, nor shall the ownership, sale, or transfer of shares of any bank holding company be conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon the ownership, sale, or transfer of shares of any other company except a bank or a bank holding company.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) shares of any company the activities of which had been determined by the Board by regulation or order under this paragraph as of the day before November 12, 1999, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto (subject to such terms and conditions contained in such regulation or order, unless modified by the Board);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) shares held or activities conducted by any company organized under the laws of a foreign country the greater part of whose business is conducted outside the United States, if the Board by regulation or order determines that, under the circumstances and subject to the conditions set forth in the regulation or order, the exemption would not be substantially at variance with the purposes of this chapter and would be in the public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) No bank holding company shall invest in an export trading company under this paragraph unless the Board has been given sixty days’ prior written notice of such proposed investment and within such period has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed investment or extending for up to another thirty days the period during which such disapproval may be issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The period for disapproval may be extended for such additional thirty-day period only if the Board determines that a bank holding company proposing to invest in an export trading company has not furnished all the information required to be submitted or that in the Board's judgment any material information submitted is substantially inaccurate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) The Board may disapprove any proposed investment only if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) such disapproval is necessary to prevent unsafe or unsound banking practices, undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, or conflicts of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the Board finds that such investment would affect the financial or managerial resources of a bank holding company to an extent which is likely to have a materially adverse effect on the safety and soundness of any subsidiary bank of such bank holding company, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) No provision of any other Federal law in effect on October 1, 1982, relating specifically to collateral requirements shall apply with respect to any such extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) No bank holding company or subsidiary of such company which invests in an export trading company may extend credit to such export trading company or to customers of such export trading company on terms more favorable than those afforded similar borrowers in similar circumstances, and such extension of credit shall not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, an export trading company—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may engage in or hold shares of a company engaged in the business of underwriting, selling, or distributing securities in the United States only to the extent that any bank holding company which invests in such export trading company may do so under applicable Federal and State banking laws and regulations; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted or construed as approving any act, action, or conduct which is or has been or may be in violation of existing law, nor shall anything herein <!-- PDFPage:1225 -->contained constitute a defense to any action, suit, or proceeding pending or hereafter instituted on account of any prohibited antitrust or monopolistic act, action, or conduct, except as specifically provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Antitrust review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval by it pursuant to <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode> of a proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction and, if the transaction also involves an acquisition under <uscode edition="2009" section="1843" title="12">section 1843 of this title</uscode>, the Board shall also notify the Federal Trade Commission of such approval. If the Board has found that it must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of a bank or bank holding company involved in any such transaction, the transaction may be consummated immediately upon approval by the Board. If the Board has advised the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority, as the case may be, of the existence of an emergency requiring expeditious action and has required the submission of views and recommendations within ten days, the transaction may not be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of approval by the Board. In all other cases, the transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of approval by the Board or, if the Board has not received any adverse comment from the Attorney General of the United States relating to competitive factors, such shorter period of time as may be prescribed by the Board with the concurrence of the Attorney General, but in no event less than 15 calendar days after the date of approval. Any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of an acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode> shall be commenced prior to the earliest time under this subsection at which the transaction approval under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode> might be consummated. The commencement of such an action shall stay the effectiveness of the Board's approval unless the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any such action, the court shall review de novo the issues presented. In any judicial proceeding attacking any acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved pursuant to <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode> on the ground that such transaction alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="2009" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>, the standards applied by the court shall be identical with those that the Board is directed to apply under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode>. Upon the consummation of an acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode> in compliance with this chapter and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this section, or upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="2009" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>, but nothing in this chapter shall exempt any bank holding company involved in such a transaction from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section 1823(f) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation learns that a bank insured by such Corporation is in danger of closing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Corporation is considering assisting the acquisition of such bank and its affiliated banks by another bank or holding company under <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2009" section="1823" title="12">section 1823(f) of this title</uscode> and such acquisition is subject to the approval of the Board under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode>;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Corporation shall immediately notify the Board of such facts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon receipt of notice from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under subparagraph (A) or at such earlier time as deemed appropriate by the Board, the Board shall immediately notify the Attorney General of the United States of the facts concerning the possible acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Within 5 days of receiving notice under subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall notify the Board in writing of the Attorney General's preliminary finding as to the consistency of the possible acquisition with the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Board may reduce or eliminate the post-approval waiting period established under paragraph (1) for an acquisition to which this paragraph applies, except that such period may not be eliminated or reduced to less than 5 days without the concurrence of the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Antitrust proceedings; Board and State banking agency as party; representation by counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of any acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved by the Board under <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode>, the Board and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved, may appear as a party of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of merger transactions consummated prior or subsequent to May 9, 1956, and not in litigation prior to July 1, 1966</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842(a) of this title</uscode> which was consummated at any time prior or subsequent to May 9, 1956, and as to which no litigation was initiated by the Attorney General prior to July 1, 1966, shall be conclusively presumed not to have been in violation of any antitrust laws other than <uscode edition="2009" section="2" title="15">section 2 of title 15</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Antitrust litigation; substantive law applicable to proceedings pending on or after July 1, 1966, with respect to merger transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any court having pending before it on or after July 1, 1966, any litigation initiated under the <!-- PDFPage:1226 -->antitrust laws by the Attorney General with respect to any acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842(a) of this title</uscode> shall apply the substantive rule of law set forth in <uscode edition="2009" section="1842" title="12">section 1842 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) “Antitrust laws” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term “antitrust laws” means the Act of July 2, 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act), the Act of October 15, 1914 (the Clayton Act), and any other Acts in pari materia.</p>
