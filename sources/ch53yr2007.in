<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) human beings and the environment are being exposed each year to a large number of chemical substances and mixtures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) among the many chemical substances and mixtures which are constantly being developed and produced, there are some whose man<!-- PDFPage:1368 -->ufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effective regulation of interstate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures also necessitates the regulation of intrastate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) adequate data should be developed with respect to the effect of chemical substances and mixtures on health and the environment and that the development of such data should be the responsibility of those who manufacture and those who process such chemical substances and mixtures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adequate authority should exist to regulate chemical substances and mixtures which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and to take action with respect to chemical substances and mixtures which are imminent hazards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authority over chemical substances and mixtures should be exercised in such a manner as not to impede unduly or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation while fulfilling the primary purpose of this chapter to assure that such innovation and commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures do not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Intent of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of Congress that the Administrator shall carry out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner, and that the Administrator shall consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action the Administrator takes or proposes to take under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Testing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A)(i) the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there are insufficient data and experience upon which the effects of such manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on <!-- PDFPage:1370 -->health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such data; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) a chemical substance or mixture is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and (I) it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or (II) there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to such substance or mixture,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there are insufficient data and experience upon which the effects of the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a mixture, the effects which the mixture's manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal or any combination of such activities may have on health or the environment may not be reasonably and more efficiently determined or predicted by testing the chemical substances which comprise the mixture;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator shall by rule require that testing be conducted on such substance or mixture to develop data with respect to the health and environmental effects for which there is an insufficiency of data and experience and which are relevant to a determination that the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing requirement rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule under subsection (a) of this section shall include—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identification of the chemical substance or mixture for which testing is required under the rule,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) standards for the development of test data for such substance or mixture, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to chemical substances which are not new chemical substances and to mixtures, a specification of the period (which period may not be of unreasonable duration) within which the persons required to conduct the testing shall submit to the Administrator data developed in accordance with the standards referred to in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the standards and period to be included, pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in a rule under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator's considerations shall include the relative costs of the various test protocols and methodologies which may be required under the rule and the reasonably foreseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testing required under the rule. Any such rule may require the submission to the Administrator of preliminary data during the period prescribed under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The health and environmental effects for which standards for the development of test data may be prescribed include carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, teratogenesis, behavioral disorders, cumulative or synergistic effects, and any other effect which may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The characteristics of chemical substances and mixtures for which such standards may be prescribed include persistence, acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and any other characteristic which may present such a risk. The methodologies that may be prescribed in such standards include epidemiologic studies, serial or hierarchical tests, in vitro tests, and whole animal tests, except that before prescribing epidemiologic studies of employees, the Administrator shall consult with the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From time to time, but not less than once each 12 months, the Administrator shall review the adequacy of the standards for development of data prescribed in rules under subsection (a) of this section and shall, if necessary, institute proceedings to make appropriate revisions of such standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A rule under subsection (a) of this section respecting a chemical substance or mixture shall require the persons described in subparagraph (B) to conduct tests and submit data to the Administrator on such substance or mixture, except that the Administrator may permit two or more of such persons to designate one such person or a qualified third party to conduct such tests and submit such data on behalf of the persons making the designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The following persons shall be required to conduct tests and submit data on a chemical substance or mixture subject to a rule under subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Each person who manufactures or intends to manufacture such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) or (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section with respect to the manufacture of such substance or mixture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Each person who processes or intends to process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) or (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section with respect to the processing of such substance or mixture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Each person who manufactures or processes or intends to manufacture or process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) or (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section with respect to the distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any rule under subsection (a) of this section requiring the testing of and submission of data for a particular chemical substance or mixture shall expire at the end of the reimbursement period (as defined in subsection (c)(3)(B) of this section) which is applicable to test data for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator repeals the rule before such date; and a rule under subsection (a) of this section requiring the testing of and submission of data for a category of chemical substances or mixtures <!-- PDFPage:1371 -->shall expire with respect to a chemical substance or mixture included in the category at the end of the reimbursement period (as so defined) which is applicable to test data for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator before such date repeals the application of the rule to such substance or mixture or repeals the rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Rules issued under subsection (a) of this section (and any substantive amendment thereto or repeal thereof) shall be promulgated pursuant to <uscode edition="2007" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode> except that (A) the Administrator shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions; (B) a transcript shall be made of any oral presentation; and (C) the Administrator shall make and publish with the rule the findings described in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of subsection (a) of this section and, in the case of a rule respecting a mixture, the finding described in paragraph (2) of such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person required by a rule under subsection (a) of this section to conduct tests and submit data on a chemical substance or mixture may apply to the Administrator (in such form and manner as the Administrator shall prescribe) for an exemption from such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, upon receipt of an application under paragraph (1), the Administrator determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the chemical substance or mixture with respect to which such application was submitted is equivalent to a chemical substance or mixture for which data has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with a rule under subsection (a) of this section or for which data is being developed pursuant to such a rule, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) submission of data by the applicant on such substance or mixture would be duplicative of data which has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with such rule or which is being developed pursuant to such rule,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator shall exempt, in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4), the applicant from conducting tests and submitting data on such substance or mixture under the rule with respect to which such application was submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit test data on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the existence of previously submitted test data and if such exemption is granted during the reimbursement period for such test data (as prescribed by subparagraph (B)), then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to the person who previously submitted such test data, for a portion of the costs incurred by such person in complying with the requirement to submit such data, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to such costs, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider all relevant factors, including the effect on the competitive position of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the person to be reimbursed and the share of the market for such substance or mixture of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the share of such market of the persons to be reimbursed. An order under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reimbursement period for any test data for a chemical substance or mixture is a period—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) beginning on the date such data is submitted in accordance with a rule promulgated under subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) ending—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) five years after the date referred to in clause (i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the expiration of a period which begins on the date referred to in clause (i) and which is equal to the period which the Administrator determines was necessary to develop such data,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit test data on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the fact that test data is being developed by one or more persons pursuant to a rule promulgated under subsection (a) of this section, then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to each such person who is developing such test data, for a portion of the costs incurred by each such person in complying with such rule, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to the costs of complying with such rule, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider the factors described in the second sentence of paragraph (3)(A). An order under this subparagraph shall, <!-- PDFPage:1372 -->for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any exemption is granted under paragraph (2) on the basis of the fact that one or more persons are developing test data pursuant to a rule promulgated under subsection (a) of this section and if after such exemption is granted the Administrator determines that no such person has complied with such rule, the Administrator shall (i) after providing written notice to the person who holds such exemption and an opportunity for a hearing, by order terminate such exemption, and (ii) notify in writing such person of the requirements of the rule with respect to which such exemption was granted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the receipt of any test data pursuant to a rule under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall publish a notice of the receipt of such data in the Federal Register within 15 days of its receipt. Subject to <uscode edition="2007" section="2613" title="15">section 2613 of this title</uscode>, each such notice shall (1) identify the chemical substance or mixture for which data have been received; (2) list the uses or intended uses of such substance or mixture and the information required by the applicable standards for the development of test data; and (3) describe the nature of the test data developed. Except as otherwise provided in <uscode edition="2007" section="2613" title="15">section 2613 of this title</uscode>, such data shall be made available by the Administrator for examination by any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) There is established a committee to make recommendations to the Administrator respecting the chemical substances and mixtures to which the Administrator should give priority consideration for the promulgation of a rule under subsection (a) of this section. In making such a recommendation with respect to any chemical substance or mixture, the committee shall consider all relevant factors, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the quantities in which the substance or mixture is or will be manufactured,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the quantities in which the substance or mixture enters or will enter the environment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of individuals who are or will be exposed to the substance or mixture in their places of employment and the duration of such exposure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the extent to which human beings are or will be exposed to the substance or mixture,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the extent to which the substance or mixture is closely related to a chemical substance or mixture which is known to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the existence of data concerning the effects of the substance or mixture on health or the environment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) the extent to which testing of the substance or mixture may result in the development of data upon which the effects of the substance or mixture on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) the reasonably foreseeable availability of facilities and personnel for performing testing on the substance or mixture.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The recommendations of the committee shall be in the form of a list of chemical substances and mixtures which shall be set forth, either by individual substance or mixture or by groups of substances or mixtures, in the order in which the committee determines the Administrator should take action under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the substances and mixtures. In establishing such list, the committee shall give priority attention to those chemical substances and mixtures which are known to cause or contribute to or which are suspected of causing or contributing to cancer, gene mutations, or birth defects. The committee shall designate chemical substances and mixtures on the list with respect to which the committee determines the Administrator should, within 12 months of the date on which such substances and mixtures are first designated, initiate a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section. The total number of chemical substances and mixtures on the list which are designated under the preceding sentence may not, at any time, exceed 50.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As soon as practicable but not later than nine months after January 1, 1977, the committee shall publish in the Federal Register and transmit to the Administrator the list and designations required by subparagraph (A) together with the reasons for the committee's inclusion of each chemical substance or mixture on the list. At least every six months after the date of the transmission to the Administrator of the list pursuant to the preceeding <sup><a href="#2603_1_target" name="2603_1">1</a></sup> sentence, the committee shall make such previsions in the list as it determines to be necessary and shall transmit them to the Administrator together with the committee's reasons for the revisions. Upon receipt of any such revision, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the list with such revision, the reasons for such revision, and the designations made under subparagraph (A). The Administrator shall provide reasonable opportunity to any interested person to file with the Administrator written comments on the committee's list, any revision of such list by the committee, and designations made by the committee, and shall make such comments available to the public. Within the 12-month period beginning on the date of the first inclusion on the list of a chemical substance or mixture designated by the committee under subparagraph (A) the Administrator shall with respect to such chemical substance or mixture either initiate a rulemaking proceeding under subsection (a) of this section or if such a proceeding is not initiated within such period, publish in the Federal Register the Administrator's reason for not initiating such a proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The committee established by paragraph (1)(A) shall consist of eight members as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) One member appointed by the Administrator from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance to be subject to a proposed order issued under subparagraph (A) files with the Administrator (within the 30-day period beginning on the date such manufacturer or processor received the notice required by subparagraph (B)(ii)) objections specifying with particularity the provisions of the order deemed objectionable and stating the grounds therefor, the proposed order shall not take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), if with respect to a chemical substance with respect to which notice is required by subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator makes the determination described in paragraph (1)(A) and if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Administrator does not issue a proposed order under paragraph (1) respecting such substance, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the Administrator issues such an order respecting such substance but such order does not take effect because objections were filed under paragraph (1)(C) with respect to it,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator, through attorneys of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States district court for the judicial district in which the manufacturer or processor, as the case may be, of such substance is found, resides, or transacts business for an injunction to prohibit or limit the manu<!-- PDFPage:1376 -->facture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance (or to prohibit or limit any combination of such activities).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Administrator issues a proposed order under paragraph (1)(A) respecting a chemical substance but such order does not take effect because objections have been filed under paragraph (1)(C) with respect to it, the Administrator is not required to apply for an injunction under clause (i) respecting such substance if the Administrator determines, on the basis of such objections, that the determinations under paragraph (1)(A) may not be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A district court of the United States which receives an application under subparagraph (A)(i) for an injunction respecting a chemical substance shall issue such injunction if the court finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of a chemical substance with respect to which notice is required by subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) in the absence of sufficient information to permit the Administrator to make such an evaluation, the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance, or any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Pending the completion of a proceeding for the issuance of an injunction under subparagraph (B) respecting a chemical substance, the court may, upon application of the Administrator made through attorneys of the Environmental Protection Agency, issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction to prohibit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such a substance (or any combination of such activities) if the court finds that the notification period applicable under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section to the manufacturing or processing of such substance may expire before such proceeding can be completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After the submission to the Administrator of test data sufficient to evaluate the health and environmental effects of a chemical substance subject to an injunction issued under subparagraph (B) and the evaluation of such data by the Administrator, the district court of the United States which issued such injunction shall, upon petition dissolve the injunction unless the Administrator has initiated a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2007" section="2605" title="15">section 2605(a) of this title</uscode> respecting the substance. If such a proceeding has been initiated, such court shall continue the injunction in effect until the effective date of the rule promulgated in such proceeding or, if such proceeding is terminated without the promulgation of a rule, upon the termination of the proceeding, whichever occurs first.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Protection against unreasonable risks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Administrator finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance with respect to which notice is required by subsection (a) of this section, or that any combination of such activities, presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment before a rule promulgated under <uscode edition="2007" section="2605" title="15">section 2605 of this title</uscode> can protect against such risk, the Administrator shall, before the expiration of the notification period applicable under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section to the manufacturing or processing of such substance, take the action authorized by paragraph (2) or (3) to the extent necessary to protect against such risk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may issue a proposed rule under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2007" section="2605" title="15">section 2605(a) of this title</uscode> to apply to a chemical substance with respect to which a finding was made under paragraph (1)—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) apply, through attorneys of the Environmental Protection Agency, to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States district court for the judicial district in which the manufacturer, or processor, as the case may be, of such substance, is found, resides, or transacts business for an injunction to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">A proposed order issued under clause (i) respecting a chemical substance shall take effect on the expiration of the notification period applicable under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section to the manufacture or processing of such substance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the district court of the United States to which an application has been made under subparagraph (A)(ii) finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance with respect to which such application was made, or that any combination of such activities, presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment before a rule promulgated under <uscode edition="2007" section="2605" title="15">section 2605 of this title</uscode> can protect against such risk, the court shall issue an injunction to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or to prohibit any combination of such activities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1377 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (e)(1) of this section shall apply with respect to an order issued under clause (i) of subparagraph (A); and the provisions of subparagraph (C) of subsection (e)(2) of this section shall apply with respect to an injunction issued under subparagraph (B).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Statement of reasons for not taking action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator has not initiated any action under this section or <uscode edition="2007" range="2605 or 2606" section="2605" title="15">section 2605 or 2606 of this title</uscode> to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance, with respect to which notification or data is required by subsection (a)(1)(B) or (b) of this section, before the expiration of the notification period applicable to the manufacturing or processing of such substance, the Administrator shall publish a statement of the Administrator's reasons for not initiating such action. Such a statement shall be published in the Federal Register before the expiration of such period. Publication of such statement in accordance with the preceding sentence is not a prerequisite to the manufacturing or processing of the substance with respect to which the statement is to be published.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may, upon application, exempt any person from any requirement of subsection (a) or (b) of this section to permit such person to manufacture or process a chemical substance for test marketing purposes—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon a showing by such person satisfactory to the Administrator that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of such substance, and that any combination of such activities, for such purposes will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under such restrictions as the Administrator considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator may, upon application, exempt any person from the requirement of subsection (b)(2) of this section to submit data for a chemical substance. If, upon receipt of an application under the preceding sentence, the Administrator determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the chemical substance with respect to which such application was submitted is equivalent to a chemical substance for which data has been submitted to the Administrator as required by subsection (b)(2) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) submission of data by the applicant on such substance would be duplicative of data which has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with such subsection,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator shall exempt the applicant from the requirement to submit such data on such substance. No exemption which is granted under this subparagraph with respect to the submission of data for a chemical substance may take effect before the beginning of the reimbursement period applicable to such data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Administrator exempts any person, under subparagraph (A), from submitting data required under subsection (b)(2) of this section for a chemical substance because of the existence of previously submitted data and if such exemption is granted during the reimbursement period for such data, then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to such costs, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider all relevant factors, including the effect on the competitive position of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the persons to be reimbursed and the share of the market for such substance of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the share of such market of the persons to be reimbursed. For purposes of judicial review, an order under this subparagraph shall be considered final agency action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the reimbursement period for any previously submitted data for a chemical substance is a period—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) beginning on the date of the termination of the prohibition, imposed under this section, on the manufacture or processing of such substance by the person who submitted such data to the Administrator, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) ending—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) five years after the date referred to in clause (i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the expiration of a period which begins on the date referred to in clause (i) and is equal to the period which the Administrator determines was necessary to develop such data,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not apply with respect to the manufacturing or processing of any chemical substance which is manufactured or processed, or proposed to be manufactured or processed, only in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) scientific experimentation or analysis, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1378 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) chemical research on, or analysis of such substance or another substance, including such research or analysis for the development of a product,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">if all persons engaged in such experimentation, research, or analysis for a manufacturer or processor are notified (in such form and manner as the Administrator may prescribe) of any risk to health which the manufacturer, processor, or the Administrator has reason to believe may be associated with such chemical substance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Administrator may, upon application and by rule, exempt the manufacturer of any new chemical substance from all or part of the requirements of this section if the Administrator determines that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such chemical substance, or that any combination of such activities, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. A rule promulgated under this paragraph (and any substantive amendment to, or repeal of, such a rule) shall be promulgated in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2007" section="2605" title="15">section 2605(c) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Administrator may, upon application, make the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section inapplicable with respect to the manufacturing or processing of any chemical substance (A) which exists temporarily as a result of a chemical reaction in the manufacturing or processing of a mixture or another chemical substance, and (B) to which there is no, and will not be, human or environmental exposure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Immediately upon receipt of an application under paragraph (1) or (5) the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the receipt of such application. The Administrator shall give interested persons an opportunity to comment upon any such application and shall, within 45 days of its receipt, either approve or deny the application. The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the approval or denial of such an application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator shall by rule apply one or more of the following requirements to such substance or mixture to the extent necessary to protect adequately against such risk using the least burdensome requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A requirement (A) prohibiting the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture, or (B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A requirement that such substance or mixture or any article containing such substance or mixture be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings and instructions with respect to its use, distribution in commerce, or disposal or with respect to any combination of such activities. The form and content of such warnings and instructions shall be prescribed by the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A requirement that manufacturers and processors of such substance or mixture make and retain records of the processes used to manufacture or process such substance or mixture and monitor or conduct tests which are reasonable and necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of any rule applicable under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of commercial use of such substance or mixture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of disposal of such substance or mixture, or of any article containing such substance or mixture, by its manufacturer or processor or by any other person who uses, or disposes of, it for commercial purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A requirement directing manufacturers or processors of such substance or mixture (A) to give notice of such unreasonable risk of injury to distributors in commerce of such substance or mixture and, to the extent reasonably ascertainable, to other persons in possession of such substance or mixture or exposed to such substance or mixture, (B) to give public notice of such risk of injury, and (C) to replace or repurchase such substance or mixture as elected by the person to which the requirement is directed.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any requirement (or combination of requirements) imposed under this subsection may be limited in application to specified geographic areas.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1379 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Quality control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator has a reasonable basis to conclude that a particular manufacturer or processor is manufacturing or processing a chemical substance or mixture in a manner which unintentionally causes the chemical substance or mixture to present or which will cause it to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Administrator may by order require such manufacturer or processor to submit a description of the relevant quality control procedures followed in the manufacturing or processing of such chemical substance or mixture; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Administrator determines—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that such quality control procedures are inadequate to prevent the chemical substance or mixture from presenting such risk of injury, the Administrator may order the manufacturer or processor to revise such quality control procedures to the extent necessary to remedy such inadequacy; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the use of such quality control procedures has resulted in the distribution in commerce of chemical substances or mixtures which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator may order the manufacturer or processor to (i) give notice of such risk to processors or distributors in commerce of any such substance or mixture, or to both, and, to the extent reasonably ascertainable, to any other person in possession of or exposed to any such substance, (ii) to give public notice of such risk, and (iii) to provide such replacement or repurchase of any such substance or mixture as is necessary to adequately protect health or the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">A determination under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) shall be made on the record after opportunity for hearing in accordance with <uscode edition="2007" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode>. Any manufacturer or processor subject to a requirement to replace or repurchase a chemical substance or mixture may elect either to replace or repurchase the substance or mixture and shall take either such action in the manner prescribed by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Promulgation of subsection (a) rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In promulgating any rule under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall consider and publish a statement with respect to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effects of such substance or mixture on health and the magnitude of the exposure of human beings to such substance or mixture,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effects of such substance or mixture on the environment and the magnitude of the exposure of the environment to such substance or mixture,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the benefits of such substance or mixture for various uses and the availability of substitutes for such uses, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule, after consideration of the effect on the national economy, small business, technological innovation, the environment, and public health.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Administrator determines that a risk of injury to health or the environment could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under another Federal law (or laws) administered in whole or in part by the Administrator, the Administrator may not promulgate a rule under subsection (a) of this section to protect against such risk of injury unless the Administrator finds, in the Administrator's discretion, that it is in the public interest to protect against such risk under this chapter. In making such a finding the Administrator shall consider (i) all relevant aspects of the risk, as determined by the Administrator in the Administrator's discretion, (ii) a comparison of the estimated costs of complying with actions taken under this chapter and under such law (or laws), and (iii) the relative efficiency of actions under this chapter and under such law (or laws) to protect against such risk of injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When prescribing a rule under subsection (a) the Administrator shall proceed in accordance with <uscode edition="2007" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode> (without regard to any reference in such section to sections 556 and 557 of such title), and shall also (A) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking stating with particularity the reason for the proposed rule; (B) allow interested persons to submit written data, views, and arguments, and make all such submissions publicly available; (C) provide an opportunity for an informal hearing in accordance with paragraph (3); (D) promulgate, if appropriate, a final rule based on the matter in the rulemaking record (as defined in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2007" section="2618" title="15">section 2618(a) of this title</uscode>), and (E) make and publish with the rule the finding described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Informal hearings required by paragraph (2)(C) shall be conducted by the Administrator in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an interested person is entitled—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to present such person's position orally or by documentary submissions (or both), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the Administrator determines that there are disputed issues of material fact it is necessary to resolve, to present such rebuttal submissions and to conduct (or have conducted under subparagraph (B)(ii)) such cross-examination of persons as the Administrator determines (I) to be appropriate, and (II) to be required for a full and true disclosure with respect to such issues.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Administrator may prescribe such rules and make such rulings concerning procedures in such hearings to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules or rulings may include (i) the imposition of reasonable time limits on each interested person's oral presentations, and (ii) requirements that any cross-examination to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph (A) be conducted by the Administrator on behalf of that person in such manner as the Administrator determines (I) to be appropriate, and (II) to be required for a full and true disclosure with respect to disputed issues of material fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), if a group of persons each of whom under subparagraphs (A) and (B) would be entitled to con<!-- PDFPage:1380 -->duct (or have conducted) cross-examination and who are determined by the Administrator to have the same or similar interests in the proceeding cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for purposes of cross-examination, the Administrator may make rules and rulings (I) limiting the representation of such interest for such purposes, and (II) governing the manner in which such cross-examination shall be limited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) When any person who is a member of a group with respect to which the Administrator has made a determination under clause (i) is unable to agree upon group representation with the other members of the group, then such person shall not be denied under the authority of clause (i) the opportunity to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting the person's particular interests if (I) the person satisfies the Administrator that the person has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon group representation with the other members of the group and (II) the Administrator determines that there are substantial and relevant issues which are not adequately presented by the group representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A verbatim transcript shall be taken of any oral presentation made, and cross-examination conducted in any informal hearing under this subsection. Such transcript shall be available to the public.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Administrator may, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Administrator, provide compensation for reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, and other costs of participating in a rulemaking proceeding for the promulgation of a rule under subsection (a) of this section to any person—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) who represents an interest which would substantially contribute to a fair determination of the issues to be resolved in the proceeding, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the economic interest of such person is small in comparison to the costs of effective participation in the proceeding by such person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) such person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such person does not have sufficient resources adequately to participate in the proceeding without compensation under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining for purposes of clause (i) if an interest will substantially contribute to a fair determination of the issues to be resolved in a proceeding, the Administrator shall take into account the number and complexity of such issues and the extent to which representation of such interest will contribute to widespread public participation in the proceeding and representation of a fair balance of interests for the resolution of such issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining whether compensation should be provided to a person under subparagraph (A) and the amount of such compensation, the Administrator shall take into account the financial burden which will be incurred by such person in participating in the rulemaking proceeding. The Administrator shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the aggregate amount of compensation paid under this paragraph in any fiscal year to all persons who, in rulemaking proceedings in which they receive compensation, are persons who either—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) would be regulated by the proposed rule, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) represent persons who would be so regulated,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">may not exceed 25 per centum of the aggregate amount paid as compensation under this paragraph to all persons in such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Paragraph (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection apply to the promulgation of a rule repealing, or making a substantive amendment to, a rule promulgated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall specify in any rule under subsection (a) of this section the date on which it shall take effect, which date shall be as soon as feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator may declare a proposed rule under subsection (a) of this section to be effective upon its publication in the Federal Register and until the effective date of final action taken, in accordance with subparagraph (B), respecting such rule if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Administrator determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture subject to such proposed rule or any combination of such activities is likely to result in an unreasonable risk of serious or widespread injury to health or the environment before such effective date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) making such proposed rule so effective is necessary to protect the public interest; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or distribution of a chemical substance or mixture because of the risk determined under clause (i)(I), a court has in an action under <uscode edition="2007" section="2606" title="15">section 2606 of this title</uscode> granted relief with respect to such risk associated with such substance or mixture.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such a proposed rule which is made so effective shall not, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Administrator makes a proposed rule effective upon its publication in the Federal Register, the Administrator shall, as expeditiously as possible, give interested persons prompt notice of such action, provide reasonable opportunity, in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section, for a hearing on such rule, and either promulgate such rule (as proposed or with modifications) or revoke it; and if such a hearing is requested, the Administrator shall commence the hearing within five days from the date such request is made unless the Administrator and the person making the request agree upon a later date for the hearing to begin, and after the hearing is concluded the Administrator shall, within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing, either promulgate such rule (as proposed or with modifications) or revoke it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within six months after January 1, 1977, the Administrator shall promulgate rules to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prescribe methods for the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require polychlorinated biphenyls to be marked with clear and adequate warnings, and instructions with respect to their processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal or with respect to any combination of such activities.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Requirements prescribed by rules under this paragraph shall be consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided under subparagraph (B), effective one year after January 1, 1977, no person may manufacture, process, or distribute in commerce or use any polychlorinated biphenyl in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator may by rule authorize the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce or use (or any combination of such activities) of any polychlorinated biphenyl in a manner other than in a totally enclosed manner if the Administrator finds that such manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use (or combination of such activities) will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “totally enclosed manner” means any manner which will ensure that any exposure of human beings or the environment to a polychlorinated biphenyl will be insignificant as determined by the Administrator by rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) no person may manufacture any polychlorinated biphenyl after two years after January 1, 1977, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no person may process or distribute in commerce any polychlorinated biphenyl after two and one-half years after such date.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person may petition the Administrator for an exemption from the requirements of subparagraph (A), and the Administrator may grant by rule such an exemption if the Administrator finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment would not result, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) good faith efforts have been made to develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and which may be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">An exemption granted under this subparagraph shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may prescribe and shall be in effect for such period (but not more than 1 year from the date it is granted, except as provided in subparagraph (D)) as the Administrator may prescribe.</p>

The Administrator shall promptly publish notice of such extension in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any rule under paragraph (1), (2)(B), or (3)(B) shall be promulgated in accordance with paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Laws not administered by the Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Administrator has reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and determines, in the Administrator's discretion, that such risk may be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken under a Federal law not administered by the Administrator, the Administrator shall submit to the agency which administers such law a report which describes such risk and includes in such description a specification of the activity or combination of activities which the Administrator has reason to believe so presents such risk. Such report shall also request such agency—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) to determine if the risk described in such report may be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken under such law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the agency determines that such risk may be so prevented or reduced, to issue an order declaring whether or not the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of such risk presents such risk; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to respond to the Administrator with respect to the matters described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any report of the Administrator shall include a detailed statement of the information on which it is based and shall be published in the Federal Register. The agency receiving a request under such a report shall make the requested determination, issue the requested order, and make the requested response within such time as the Administrator specifies in the request, but such time specified may not be less than 90 days from the date the request was made. The response of an agency shall be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the agency and shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator makes a report under paragraph (1) with respect to a chemical substance or mixture and the agency to which such report was made either—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) issues an order declaring that the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of the risk described in the report does not present the risk described in the report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) initiates, within 90 days of the publication in the Federal Register of the response of the agency under paragraph (1), action under the law (or laws) administered by such agency to protect against such risk associated with such activity or combination of activities,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator may not take any action under <uscode edition="2007" range="2605 or 2606" section="2605" title="15">section 2605 or 2606 of this title</uscode> with respect to such risk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Administrator has initiated action under <uscode edition="2007" range="2605 or 2606" section="2605" title="15">section 2605 or 2606 of this title</uscode> with respect to a risk associated with a chemical substance or mixture which was the subject of a report made to an agency under paragraph (1), such agency shall before taking action under the law (or laws) administered by it to protect against such risk consult with the Administrator for the purpose of avoiding duplication of Federal action against such risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Laws administered by the Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall coordinate actions taken under this chapter with actions taken under other Federal laws administered in whole or in part by the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that a risk to health or the environment associated with a chemical substance or mixture could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under the authorities contained in such other Federal laws, the Administrator shall use such authorities to protect against such risk unless the Administrator determines, in the Administrator's discretion, that it is in the public interest to protect against such risk by actions taken under this chapter. This subsection shall not be construed to relieve the Administrator of any requirement imposed on the Administrator by such other Federal laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Occupational safety and health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising any authority under this chapter, the Administrator shall not, for purposes of <uscode detail="(b)(1)" edition="2007" section="653" title="29">section 653(b)(1) of title 29</uscode>, be deemed to be exercising statutory authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering this chapter, the Administrator shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of any other appropriate Federal executive department or agency, any relevant independent regulatory agency, and any other appropriate instrumentality of the Federal Government for the purpose of achieving the maximum enforcement of this chapter while imposing the least burdens of duplicative requirements on those subject to the chapter and for other purposes. The Administrator shall, in the report required by <uscode edition="2007" section="2629" title="15">section 2629 of this title</uscode>, report annually to the Congress on actions taken to coordi<!-- PDFPage:1386 -->nate with such other Federal departments, agencies, or instrumentalities, and on actions taken to coordinate the authority under this chapter with the authority granted under other Acts referred to in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who violates a provision of <uscode edition="2007" range="2614 or 2689" section="2614" title="15">section 2614 or 2689 of this title</uscode> shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. Each day such a violation continues shall, for purposes of this subsection, constitute a separate violation of <uscode edition="2007" range="2614 or 2689" section="2614" title="15">section 2614 or 2689 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A civil penalty for a violation of section <uscode edition="2007" range="2614 or 2689" section="2614" title="15">section 2614 or 2689 of this title</uscode> shall be assessed by the Administrator by an order made on the record after opportunity (provided in accordance with this subparagraph) for a hearing in accordance with <uscode edition="2007" section="554" title="5">section 554 of title 5</uscode>. Before issuing such an order, the Administrator shall give written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty under such order of the Administrator's proposal to issue such order and provide such person an opportunity to request, within 15 days of the date the notice is received by such person, such a hearing on the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Administrator shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of prior such violations, the degree of culpability, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administrator may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be imposed under this subsection. The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who requested in accordance with paragraph (2)(A) a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty may file a petition for judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may only be filed within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order making such assessment was issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after the order making the assessment has become a final order and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (3), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (3) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Attorney General shall recover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the expiration of the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (3) or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an action brought in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criminal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of <uscode edition="2007" range="2614 or 2689" section="2614" title="15">section 2614 or 2689 of this title</uscode>, shall, in addition to or in lieu of any civil penalty which may be imposed under subsection (a) of this section for such violation, be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $25,000 for each day of violation, or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No employer may discharge any employee or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to a request of the employee) has—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or participate in any manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any employee who believes that the employee has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) of this section may, within 30 days after such alleged violation occurs, file (or have any person file on the employee's behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) alleging such discharge or discrimination. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct an investigation of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days of the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the complainant (and any person acting on behalf of the complainant) and the person alleged to have committed such violation of the results of the investigation conducted pursuant to this paragraph. Within ninety days of the receipt of such complaint the Secretary shall, unless the proceeding on the complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person alleged to have committed such violation, issue an order either providing the relief prescribed by subparagraph (B) or denying the complaint. An order of the Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and opportunity for agency hearing. The Secretary may not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a complaint without the participation and consent of the complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1) the Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) of this section has occurred, the Secretary shall order (i) the person who committed such violation to take affirmative action to abate the violation, (ii) such person to reinstate the complainant to the complainant's former position together with the compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and privileges of the complainant's employment, (iii) compensatory damages, and (iv) where appropriate, exemplary damages. If such an order issued, the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which the order was issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any employee or employer adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under subsection (b) of this section may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review must be filed within sixty days from the issuance of the Secretary's order. Review shall conform to <uscode chapter="7" edition="2007" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1396 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) An order of the Secretary, with respect to which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1), shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a person has failed to comply with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur to enforce such order. In actions brought under this subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to any employee who, acting without direction from the employee's employer (or any agent of the employer), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of complementing (but not reducing) the authority of, or actions taken by, the Administrator under this chapter, the Administrator may make grants to States for the establishment and operation of programs to prevent or eliminate unreasonable risks within the States to health or the environment which are associated with a chemical substance or mixture and with respect to which the Administrator is unable or is not likely to take action under this chapter for their prevention or elimination. The amount of a grant under this subsection shall be determined by the Administrator, except that no grant for any State program may exceed 75 per centum of the establishment and operation costs (as determined by the Administrator) of such program during the period for which the grant is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No grant may be made under subsection (a) of this section unless an application therefor is submitted to and approved by the Administrator. Such an application shall be submitted in such form and manner as the Administrator may require and shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) set forth the need of the applicant for a grant under subsection (a) of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify the agency or agencies of the State which shall establish or operate, or both, the program for which the application is submitted,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) contain such other information as the Administrator may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may approve an application submitted in accordance with paragraph (1) only if the applicant has established to the satisfaction of the Administrator a priority need, as determined under rules of the Administrator, for the grant for which the application has been submitted. Such rules shall take into consideration the seriousness of the health effects in a State which are associated with chemical substances or mixtures, including cancer, birth defects, and gene mutations, the extent of the exposure in a State of human beings and the environment to chemical substances and mixtures, and the extent to which chemical substances and mixtures are manufactured, processed, used, and disposed of in a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Annual reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than six months after the end of each of the fiscal years 1979, 1980, and 1981, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report respecting the programs assisted by grants under subsection (a) of this section in the preceding fiscal year and the extent to which the Administrator has disseminated information respecting such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of making grants under subsection (a) of this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Sums appropriated under this subsection shall remain available until expended.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§2641. Congressional findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Environmental Protection Agency's rule on local educational agency inspection for, and notification of, the presence of friable asbestos-containing material in school buildings includes neither standards for the proper identification of asbestos-containing material and appropriate response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing material, nor a requirement that response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing material be carried out in a safe and complete manner once actions are found to be necessary. As a result of the lack of regulatory guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency, some schools have not undertaken response action while many others have undertaken expensive projects without knowing if their action is necessary, adequate, or safe. Thus, the danger of exposure to asbestos continues to exist in schools, and some exposure actually may have increased due to the lack of Federal standards and improper response action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There is no uniform program for accrediting persons involved in asbestos identification and abatement, nor are local educational agencies required to use accredited contractors for asbestos work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The guidance provided by the Environmental Protection Agency in its “Guidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Material in Buildings” is insufficient in detail to ensure adequate responses. Such guidance is intended to be used only until the regulations required by this subchapter become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Because there are no Federal standards whatsoever regulating daily exposure to asbestos in other public and commercial buildings, persons in addition to those comprising the Nation's school population may be exposed daily to asbestos.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for the establishment of Federal regulations which require inspection for asbestos-containing material and implementation of appropriate response actions with respect to asbestos-containing material in the Nation's schools in a safe and complete manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to mandate safe and complete periodic reinspection of school buildings following response actions, where appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to require the Administrator to conduct a study to find out the extent of the danger to human health posed by asbestos in public and commercial buildings and the means to respond to any such danger.</p>
