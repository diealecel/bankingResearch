<p class="note-body">This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original "This Act" meaning the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, act June 6, 1934, ch. 404. The act was divided into two titles as follows: "Title I—Regulation of Securities Exchanges" and "Title II—Amendments to Securities Act of 1933." This section was section 1 of title I of the Act, which title, as amended, is set out as <uscode edition="2015" range="78a to 78d-5, 78e to 78l, 78m, 78m-1, 78n to 78o, 78o-3, 78o-4, 78o-5 to 78o-7, 78o-10 to 78u-6, 78v to 78dd-1, 78ee to 78hh, 78mm, and 78pp" section="78a" title="15">sections 78a to 78d–5, 78e to 78l, 78m, 78m–1, 78n to 78o, 78o–3, 78o–4, 78o–5 to 78o–7, 78o–10 to 78u–6, 78v to 78dd–1, 78ee to 78hh, 78mm, and 78pp of this title</uscode>. <uscode edition="2015" range="78kk, 78ll, 78nn, and 78oo" section="78kk" title="15">Sections 78kk, 78ll, 78nn, and 78oo of this title</uscode>, which were directed to be added at the end of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, have been treated in the Code as added to title I of the Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See Codification notes set out under those sections. Title II of the act amended or repealed sections 77b to 77e, 77j, 77k, 77m, 77o, and 77s, and added former <uscode edition="2015" range="78ii and 78jj" section="78ii" title="15">sections 78ii and 78jj of this title</uscode>.

<p class="statutory-body">For the reasons hereinafter enumerated, transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are effected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and principal security holders, to require appropriate reports, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such transactions (a) are carried on in large volume by the public generally and in large part originate outside the States in which the exchanges and over-the-counter markets are located and/or are effected by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (b) constitute an important part of the current of interstate commerce; (c) involve in large part the securities of issuers engaged in interstate commerce; (d) involve the use of credit, directly affect the financing of trade, industry, and transportation in interstate commerce, and directly affect and influence the volume of interstate commerce; and affect the national credit.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The prices established and offered in such transactions are generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign countries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the prices at which securities are bought and sold, the amount of certain taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and the value of collateral for bank loans.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Frequently the prices of securities on such exchanges and markets are susceptible to manipulation and control, and the dissemination of such prices gives rise to excessive speculation, resulting in sudden and unreasonable fluctuations in the prices of securities which (a) cause alternately unreasonable expansion and unreasonable contraction of the volume of credit available for trade, transportation, and industry in interstate commerce, (b) hinder the proper appraisal of the value of securities and thus prevent a fair calculation of taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and (c) prevent the fair valuation of collateral for bank loans and/or obstruct the effective operation of the national banking system and Federal Reserve System.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) National emergencies, which produce widespread unemployment and the dislocation of trade, transportation, and industry, and which burden interstate commerce and adversely affect the general welfare, are precipitated, intensified, and prolonged by manipulation and sudden and unreasonable fluctuations of security prices and by excessive speculation on such exchanges and markets, and to meet such emergencies the Federal Government is put to such great expense as to burden the national credit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) review each submission made under subparagraphs (A) and (B), and determine whether the security-based swap, or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps, described in the submission is required to be cleared; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) provide at least a 30-day public comment period regarding its determination <!-- PDFPage:206 -->whether the clearing requirement under subsection (a)(1) shall apply to the submission.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make its determination under paragraph (2)(C) not later than 90 days after receiving a submission made under paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B), unless the submitting clearing agency agrees to an extension for the time limitation established under this paragraph.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall complete a review undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1) not later than 90 days after issuance of the stay, unless the clearing agency that clears the security-based swap, or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps, agrees to an extension of the time limitation established under this paragraph.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c_3_B"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty of Commission to investigate and take certain actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent the Commission finds that a particular security-based swap or any group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps that would otherwise be subject to mandatory clearing but no clearing agency has listed the security-based swap or the group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps for clearing, the Commission shall—</p>

<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Securities and Exchange Commission. My reasons for <!-- PDFPage:218 -->transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.</p>

The vote of one member of the Commission shall be sufficient to bring any such action before the Commission for review. A person or party shall be entitled to review by the Commission if he or it is adversely affected by action at a delegated level which (1) denies any request for action pursuant to section 77h(a) or <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2015" section="77h" title="15">section 77h(c) of this title</uscode> or the first sentence of <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2015" section="78l" title="15">section 78l(d) of this title</uscode>; (2) suspends trading in a security pursuant to <uscode detail="(k)" edition="2015" section="78l" title="15">section 78l(k) of this title</uscode>; or (3) is pursuant to any provision of this chapter in a case of adjudication, as defined in <uscode edition="2015" section="551" title="5">section 551 of title 5</uscode>, not required by this chapter to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in section 554(a)(1) through (6) of such title 5).</p>

For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection, until July 1, 1936, the lowest price at which a security has sold on or after July 1, 1933, shall be considered as the lowest price at which such security has sold during the preceding thirty-six calendar months.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resign from the engagement; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report after resignation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a registered public accounting firm resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), the firm shall, not later than 1 business day following the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the report of the firm (or the documentation of any oral report given).</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; facilitating establishment of national market system for securities; designation of qualified securities</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The securities markets are an important national asset which must be preserved and strengthened.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) New data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market operations.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) It is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) economically efficient execution of securities transactions;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C_iv"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the practicability of brokers executing investors&amp;apos; orders in the best market; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C_v"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) an opportunity, consistent with the provisions of clauses (i) and (iv) of this subparagraph, for investors&amp;apos; orders to be executed without the participation of a dealer.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities will foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investors&amp;apos; orders, and contribute to best execution of such orders.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to use its authority under this chapter to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities (which may include subsystems for particular types of securities with unique trading characteristics) in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Commission, by rule, shall designate the securities or classes of securities qualified for trading in the national market system from among securities other than exempted securities. (Securities or classes of securities so designated hereinafter <sup><a href="#78k-1_1_target" name="78k-1_1">1</a></sup> in this section referred to as "qualified securities".)</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission is authorized in furtherance of the directive in paragraph (2) of this subsection—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to create one or more advisory committees pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (which shall be in addition to the National Market Advisory Board established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section) and to employ one or more outside experts;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by rule or order, to authorize or require self-regulatory organizations to act jointly with respect to matters as to which they share authority under this chapter in planning, developing, operating, or regulating a national market system (or a subsystem thereof) or one or more facilities thereof; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to conduct studies and make recommendations to the Congress from time to time as to the possible need for modifications of the scheme of self-regulation provided for in this chapter so as to adapt it to a national market system.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Securities information processors; registration; withdrawal of registration; access to services; censure; suspension or revocation of registration</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any securities information processor unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a securities information processor. The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any securities information processor or class of securities information processors or security or class of securities from any provision of this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent <!-- PDFPage:249 -->with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, including the maintenance of fair and orderly markets in securities and the removal of impediments to and perfection of the mechanism of a national market system: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a securities information processor not acting as the exclusive processor of any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in securities is exempt from the requirement to register in accordance with this subsection unless the Commission, by rule or order, finds that the registration of such securities information processor is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or for the achievement of the purposes of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A securities information processor may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the address of its principal office, or offices, the names of the securities and markets for which it is then acting and for which it proposes to act as a securities information processor, and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe with regard to performance capability, standards and procedures for the collection, processing, distribution, and publication of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities, personnel qualifications, financial condition, and such other matters as the Commission determines to be germane to the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, or necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for registration pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, publish notice of the filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such application. Within ninety days of the date of the publication of such notice (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents) the Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant such registration, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to sixty days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer periods as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant the registration of a securities information processor if the Commission finds that such securities information processor is so organized, and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable performance of its functions as a securities information processor, comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section, and, insofar as it is acting as an exclusive processor, operate fairly and efficiently. The Commission shall deny the registration of a securities information processor if the Commission does not make any such finding.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A registered securities information processor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered securities information processor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for registration, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If any registered securities information processor prohibits or limits any person in respect of access to services offered, directly or indirectly, by such securities information processor, the registered securities information processor shall promptly file notice thereof with the Commission. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Any prohibition or limitation on access to services with respect to which a registered securities information processor is required by this paragraph to file notice shall be subject to review by the Commission on its own motion, or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby filed within thirty days after such notice has been filed with the Commission and received by such aggrieved person, or within such longer period as the Commission may determine. Application to the Commission for review, or the institution of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of such prohibition or limitation, unless the Commission otherwise orders, summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments). The Commission shall establish for appropriate cases an expedited procedure for consideration and determination of the question of a stay.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any proceeding to review the prohibition or limitation of any person in respect of access to services offered by a registered securities information processor, if the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such prohibition or limitation is consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder and that such person has not been discriminated against unfairly, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding or if it finds that such prohibition or limitation imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, the Commission, by order, shall set aside the prohibition or limitation and require the registered securities information processor to permit such person access to services offered by the registered securities information processor.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission, by order, may censure or place limitations upon the activities, functions, <!-- PDFPage:250 -->or operations of any registered securities information processor or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or revoke the registration of any such processor, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest, necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to assure the prompt, accurate, or reliable performance of the functions of such securities information processor, and that such securities information processor has violated or is unable to comply with any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules and regulations covering use of mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce; reports of purchase or sale of qualified securities; limiting registered securities transactions to national securities exchanges</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No self-regulatory organization, member thereof, securities information processor, broker, or dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to collect, process, distribute, publish, or prepare for distribution or publication any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in any security other than an exempted security, to assist, participate in, or coordinate the distribution or publication of such information, or to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any such security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter to—</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) assure that all securities information processors may, for purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and reasonable terms such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is collected, processed, or prepared for distribution or publication by any exclusive processor of such information acting in such capacity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) assure that all exchange members, brokers, dealers, securities information processors, and, subject to such limitations as the Commission, by rule, may impose as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or maintenance of fair and orderly markets, all other persons may obtain on terms which are not unreasonably discriminatory such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is published or distributed by any self-regulatory organization or securities information processor;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may require any person who has effected the purchase or sale of any qualified security by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to report such purchase or sale to a registered securities information processor, national securities exchange, or registered securities association and require such processor, exchange, or association to make appropriate distribution and publication of information with respect to such purchase or sale.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission, by rule, is authorized to prohibit brokers and dealers from effecting transactions in securities registered pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2015" section="78l" title="15">section 78l(b) of this title</uscode> otherwise than on a national securities exchange, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as a result of transactions in such securities effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange the fairness or orderliness of the markets for such securities has been affected in a manner contrary to the public interest or the protection of investors;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no rule of any national securities exchange unreasonably impairs the ability of any dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such securities for his own account or unreasonably restricts competition among dealers in such securities or between dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists in such securities and such dealers who are not specialists in such securities, and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3_A_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the maintenance or restoration of fair and orderly markets in such securities may not be assured through other lawful means under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any security or transaction or any class of securities or transactions from any such prohibition if the Commission deems such exemption consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in securities for his own account shall not be deemed to be unreasonably impaired by any rule of an exchange fairly and reasonably prescribing the sequence in which orders brought to the exchange must be executed or which has been adopted to effect compliance with a rule of the Commission promulgated under this chapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission is directed to review any and all rules of national securities exchanges which limit or condition the ability of members to effect transactions in securities otherwise than on such exchanges.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Study and report</cap-smallcap>.—The Commission shall conduct a study examining the transition to trading and quoting securities in one penny increments, also known as decimalization. The study shall examine the impact that decimalization has had on the number of initial public offerings since its implementation relative to the period before its implementation.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 180 days after October 22, 1994, the Commission shall prescribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.

<a name="substructure-location_f_1_E_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to extend unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule of such national <!-- PDFPage:254 -->securities exchange would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such securities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in such securities or between such dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists and such dealers who are not specialists.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_f_1_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privileges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligibility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964, notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If unlisted trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that security, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_f_1_G_i_II"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to filing the registration statement with respect to the offering, was not subject to the reporting requirements of <uscode edition="2015" range="78m or 78o(d)" section="78m" title="15">section 78m or 78o(d) of this title</uscode>; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privileges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trading privileges on the exchange.

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration of all persons utilizing exchange facilities to effect transactions; exemptions</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer which is either a person other than a natural person or a natural person not associated with a broker or dealer which is a person other than a natural person (other than such a broker or dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not make use of any facility of a national securities exchange) to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or commercial paper, bankers&amp;apos; acceptances, or commercial bills) unless such broker or dealer is registered in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (1) of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified in such rule or order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Manner of registration of brokers and dealers</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A broker or dealer may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such broker or dealer and any persons associated with such broker or dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within forty-five days of the date of the filing of such application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant registration, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty days of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant such registration if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The order granting registration shall not be effective until such broker or dealer has become a member of a registered securities association, or until such broker or dealer has become a member of a national securities exchange, if such broker or dealer effects transactions solely on that exchange, unless the Commission has exempted such broker or dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An application for registration of a broker or dealer to be formed or organized may be made by a broker or dealer to which the broker or dealer to be formed or organized is to be the successor. Such application, in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, shall contain such information and documents concerning the applicant, the successor, and any persons associated with the applicant or the successor, as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The grant or denial of registration to such an applicant shall be in accordance with the procedures <!-- PDFPage:288 -->set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Commission grants such registration, the registration shall terminate on the forty-fifth day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the successor shall, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, adopt the application for registration as its own.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person who is a broker or dealer solely by reason of acting as a municipal securities dealer or municipal securities broker, who so acts through a separately identifiable department or division, and who so acted in such a manner on June 4, 1975, may, in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, register such separately identifiable department or division in accordance with this subsection. If any such department or division is so registered, the department or division and not such person himself shall be the broker or dealer for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C"></a>

<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities and performances of credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, are matters of national public interest, as credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, play a critical &amp;apos;gatekeeper&amp;apos; role in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public oversight and accountability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other financial &amp;apos;gatekeepers&amp;apos; do, the activities of credit rating agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers of structured financial products on potential ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give clearer authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the economy in the United States and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part of credit rating agencies."</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; facilitating establishment of system</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement impose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) New data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The linking of all clearance and settlement facilities and the development of uniform standards and procedures for clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and increase the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this chapter—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_A_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities (other than exempt securities); and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of transactions in securities, securities options, contracts of sale for future delivery and options thereon, and commodity options;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall use its authority under this chapter to assure equal regulation under this chapter of registered clearing agencies and registered transfer agents. In carrying out its responsibilities set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, the Commission shall coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and consult with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration of clearing agencies; application; determinations by Commission requisite to registration of applicant as clearing agency; denial of participation; discipline; summary proceedings; exemption; facilities for handling derivatives</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any clearing agency, unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security (other than an exempted security). The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any clearing agency or security or any class of clearing agencies or securities from any provisions of this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds. A clearing agency or transfer agent shall not perform the functions of both a clearing agency and a transfer agent unless such clearing agency or transfer agent is registered in accordance with this subsection and subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<!-- PDFPage:364 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A clearing agency may be registered under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided in this subsection and in accordance with the provisions of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2015" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a) of this title</uscode>, by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the rules of the clearing agency and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A clearing agency shall not be registered unless the Commission determines that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Such clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions for which it is responsible, to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible, to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, to enforce (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2015" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) compliance by its participants with the rules of the clearing agency, and to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, the rules of the clearing agency provide that any (i) registered broker or dealer, (ii) other registered clearing agency, (iii) registered investment company, (iv) bank, (v) insurance company, or (vi) other person or class of persons as the Commission, by rule, may from time to time designate as appropriate to the development of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions may become a participant in such clearing agency.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The rules of the clearing agency assure a fair representation of its shareholders (or members) and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. (The Commission may determine that the representation of participants is fair if they are afforded a reasonable opportunity to acquire voting stock of the clearing agency, directly or indirectly, in reasonable proportion to their use of such clearing agency.)</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The rules of the clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its participants.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The rules of the clearing agency do not impose any schedule of prices, or fix rates or other fees, for services rendered by its participants.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and, to the extent applicable, derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination in the admission of participants or among participants in the use of the clearing agency, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this section or the administration of the clearing agency.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_G"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The rules of the clearing agency provide that (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="2015" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) its participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of any provision of the rules of the clearing agency by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, or any other fitting sanction.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_H"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The rules of the clearing agency are in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection, and, in general, provide a fair procedure with respect to the disciplining of participants, the denial of participation to any person seeking participation therein, and the prohibition or limitation by the clearing agency of any person with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3_I"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The rules of the clearing agency do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A registered clearing agency may, and in cases in which the Commission, by order, directs as appropriate in the public interest shall, deny participation to any person subject to a statutory disqualification. A registered clearing agency shall file notice with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting any person to participation, if the clearing agency knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that such person was subject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A registered clearing agency may deny participation to, or condition the participation of, any person if such person does not meet such standards of financial responsibility, operational capability, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the clearing agency. A registered clearing agency may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to be a participant in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the clearing agency.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to determine whether a participant should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph), the clearing agency shall bring specific charges, notify such participant of, and give him an opportunity to defend against such charges, and keep a record. A determination by the clearing agency to impose a disciplinary sanction shall be supported by a statement setting forth—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A_i"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any act or practice in which such participant has been found to have engaged, or which <!-- PDFPage:365 -->such participant has been found to have omitted;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the specific provisions of the rules of the clearing agency which any such act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_A_iii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to determine whether a person shall be denied participation or prohibited or limited with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency, the clearing agency shall notify such person of, and give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for denial or prohibition or limitation under consideration and keep a record. A determination by the clearing agency to deny participation or prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency shall be supported by a statement setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial or prohibition or limitation is based.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily suspend and close the accounts of a participant who (i) has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) is in default of any delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency, or (iii) is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency determines and so notifies the appropriate regulatory agency for such participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants, creditors, or investors. A participant so summarily suspended shall be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the clearing agency in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The appropriate regulatory agency for such participant, by order, may stay any such summary suspension on its own motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby, if such appropriate regulatory agency determines summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments) that such stay is consistent with the public interest and protection of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No registered clearing agency shall prohibit or limit access by any person to services offered by any participant therein.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7"></a>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) A clearing agency that is regulated directly or indirectly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through its association with a designated contract market for security futures products that is a national securities exchange registered pursuant to <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2015" section="78f" title="15">section 78f(g) of this title</uscode>, and that would be required to register pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection only because it performs the functions of a clearing agency with respect to security futures products effected pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market with which such agency is associated, is exempted from the provisions of this section and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that if such a clearing agency performs the functions of a clearing agency with respect to a security futures product that is not cash settled, it must have arrangements in place with a registered clearing agency to effect the payment and delivery of the securities underlying the security futures product.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any clearing agency that performs the functions of a clearing agency with respect to security futures products must coordinate with and develop fair and reasonable links with any and all other clearing agencies that perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to security futures products, in order to permit, as of the compliance date (as defined in section 78f(h)(6)(C) <sup><a href="#78q-1_1_target" name="78q-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title), security futures products to be purchased on one market and offset on another market that trades such products.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_8"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) A registered clearing agency shall be permitted to provide facilities for the clearance and settlement of any derivative agreements, contracts, or transactions that are excluded from the Commodity Exchange Act [<uscode edition="2015" section="1" title="7">7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.</uscode>], subject to the requirements of this section and to such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Registration of transfer agents</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any transfer agent, unless registered in accordance with this section, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the function of a transfer agent with respect to any security registered under <uscode edition="2015" section="78l" title="15">section 78l of this title</uscode> or which would be required to be registered except for the exemption from registration provided by subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of that section. The appropriate regulatory agency, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or security or class of persons or securities from any provision of this section or any rule or regulation prescribed under this section, if the appropriate regulatory agency finds (A) that such exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of this section, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds, and (B) the Commission does not object to such exemption.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the market for penny stocks suffers from a lack of reliable and accurate quotation and last sale information available to investors and regulators;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to improve significantly the information available to brokers, dealers, investors, and regulators with respect to quotations for and transactions in penny stocks; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a fully implemented automated quotation system for penny stocks would meet the information needs of investors and market participants and would add visibility and regulatory and surveillance data to that market.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Mandate to facilitate establishment of automated quotation systems</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall facilitate the widespread dissemination of reliable and accurate last sale and quotation information with respect to penny stocks in accordance with the findings set forth in subsection (a), with a view toward establishing, at the earliest feasible time, one or more automated quotation systems that will collect and disseminate information regarding all penny stocks.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Characteristics of systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each such automated quotation system shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be operated by a registered securities association or a national securities exchange in accordance with such rules as the Commission and these entities shall prescribe;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) collect and disseminate quotation and transaction information;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) except as provided in subsection (c), provide bid and ask quotations of participating brokers or dealers, or comparably accurate and reliable pricing information, which shall constitute firm bids or offers for at least such minimum numbers of shares or minimum dollar amounts as the Commission and the registered securities association or national securities exchange shall require; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provide for the reporting of the volume of penny stock transactions, including last sale reporting, when the volume reaches appropriate levels that the Commission shall specify by rule or order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptive authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, by rule or order, grant such exemptions, in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally, to any penny stock or class of penny stocks from the requirements of subsection (b) as the Commission determines to be consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Commission reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in each of the first 5 annual reports (under <uscode detail="(b)(1)" edition="2015" section="78w" title="15">section 78w(b)(1) of this title</uscode>) submitted more than 12 months after October 15, 1990, include a description of the status of the penny stock automated quotation system or systems required by subsection (b). Such description shall include—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a review of the development, implementation, and progress of the project, including achievement of significant milestones and current project schedule; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a review of the activities of registered securities associations and national securities exchanges in the development of the system.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority and discretion of Commission to investigate violations</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission may, in its discretion, make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member or a person associated, or, as to any act or practice, or omission to act, while associated with a member, formerly associated with a member, the rules of a registered clearing agency in which such person is a participant, or, as to any act or practice, or omission to act, while a participant, was a participant, the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, of which such person is a registered public accounting firm, a person associated with such a firm, or, as to any act, practice, or omission to act, while associated with such firm, a person formerly associated with such a firm, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and may require or permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Commission shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. The Commission is authorized in its discretion, to publish information concerning any such violations, and to investigate any facts, conditions, practices, or matters which it may deem necessary or proper to aid in the enforcement of such provisions, in the prescribing of rules and regulations under this chapter, or in securing information to serve as a basis for recommending further legislation concerning the matters to which this chapter relates.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On request from a foreign securities authority, the Commission may provide assistance in accordance with this paragraph if the requesting authority states that the requesting authority is conducting an investigation which it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any laws or rules relating to securities matters that the requesting authority administers or enforces. The Commission may, in its discretion, conduct such investigation as the Commission deems necessary to collect information and evidence pertinent to the request for assistance. Such assistance may be provided without regard to whether the facts stated in the request would also constitute a violation of the laws of the United States. In deciding whether to provide such assistance, the Commission shall consider whether (A) the requesting authority has agreed to provide reciprocal assistance in securities matters to the Commission; and (B) compliance with the request would prejudice the public interest of the United States.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Attendance of witnesses; production of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of any such investigation, or any other proceeding under this chapter, any member of the Commission or any officer designated by it is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, or other records which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States or any State at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial enforcement of investigative power of Commission; refusal to obey subpena; criminal sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records. And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who shall, without just cause, fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records, if in his power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or is about to engage in acts or practices constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member or a person associated with a member, the rules of a registered clearing agency in which such person is a participant, the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, of which such person is a registered public accounting firm or a person associated with such a firm, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district court of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the United States courts of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such acts or practices, and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond. The Commission may <!-- PDFPage:383 -->transmit such evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices as may constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder to the Attorney General, who may, in his discretion, institute the necessary criminal proceedings under this chapter.</p>

Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision, rule, or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Commission may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Commission deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Commission may specify, with such provision, rule, or regulation with respect to any security, any issuer, or any other person.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§78y. Court review of orders and rules</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Final Commission orders; persons aggrieved; petition; record; findings; affirmance, modification, enforcement, or setting aside of orders; remand to adduce additional evidence</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person aggrieved by a final order of the Commission entered pursuant to this chapter may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of the order, a written petition requesting that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer designated by the Commission for that purpose. Thereupon the <!-- PDFPage:411 -->Commission shall file in the court the record on which the order complained of is entered, as provided in <uscode edition="2015" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode> and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the record, to affirm or modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there was reasonable ground for failure to adduce it before the Commission, the court may remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings, in whatever manner and on whatever conditions the court considers appropriate. If the case is remanded to the Commission, it shall file in the court a supplemental record containing any new evidence, any further or modified findings, and any new order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commission rules; persons adversely affected; petition; record; affirmance, enforcement, or setting aside of rules; findings; transfer of proceedings</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person adversely affected by a rule of the Commission promulgated pursuant to section 78f, 78i(h)(2), 78k, 78k–1, 78o(c)(5) or (6), 78o–3, 78q, 78q–1, or 78s of this title may obtain review of this rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business or for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the promulgation of the rule, a written petition requesting that the rule be set aside.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer designated for that purpose. Thereupon, the Commission shall file in the court the rule under review and any documents referred to therein, the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking and any documents referred to therein, all written submissions and the transcript of any oral presentations in the rulemaking, factual information not included in the foregoing that was considered by the Commission in the promulgation of the rule or proffered by the Commission as pertinent to the rule, the report of any advisory committee received or considered by the Commission in the rulemaking, and any other materials prescribed by the court.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the materials set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection, to affirm and enforce or to set aside the rule.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts identified by the Commission as the basis, in whole or in part, of the rule, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. The court shall affirm and enforce the rule unless the Commission's action in promulgating the rule is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; or without observance of procedure required by law.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If proceedings have been instituted under this subsection in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same rule, the Commission shall file the materials set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection in that court in which a proceeding was first instituted. The other courts shall thereupon transfer all such proceedings to the court in which the materials have been filed. For the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice that court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Objections not urged before Commission; stay of orders and rules; transfer of enforcement or review proceedings</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No objection to an order or rule of the Commission, for which review is sought under this section, may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The filing of a petition under this section does not operate as a stay of the Commission's order or rule. Until the court's jurisdiction becomes exclusive, the Commission may stay its order or rule pending judicial review if it finds that justice so requires. After the filing of a petition under this section, the court, on whatever conditions may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, may issue all necessary and appropriate process to stay the order or rule or to preserve status or rights pending its review; but (notwithstanding <uscode edition="2015" section="705" title="5">section 705 of title 5</uscode>) no such process may be issued by the court before the filing of the record or the materials set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section unless: (A) the Commission has denied a stay or failed to grant requested relief, (B) a reasonable period has expired since the filing of an application for a stay without a decision by the Commission, or (C) there was reasonable ground for failure to apply to the Commission.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the same order or rule is the subject of one or more petitions for review filed under this section and an action for enforcement filed in a district court of the United States under section 78u(d) or (e) of this title, that court in which the petition or the action is first filed has jurisdiction with respect to the order or rule to the exclusion of any other court, and thereupon all such proceedings shall be transferred to that court; but, for the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice, that court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals or district court of the United States, whether or not a petition for review or an action for enforcement was originally filed in the transferee court. The scope of review by a district court under section 78u(d) or (e) of this title is in all cases the same as by a court of appeals under this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other appropriate regulatory agencies</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of the preceding subsections of this section, the term "Commission" includes the agencies enumerated in section 78c(a)(34) of <!-- PDFPage:412 -->this title insofar as such agencies are acting pursuant to this chapter and the Secretary of the Treasury insofar as he is acting pursuant to <uscode edition="2015" section="78o-5" title="15">section 78o–5 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(4) of this section and <uscode edition="2015" section="706" title="5">section 706 of title 5</uscode>, an order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2015" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a) of this title</uscode> denying registration to a clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency or pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2015" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(b) of this title</uscode> disapproving a proposed rule change by such a clearing agency shall be deemed to be an order of the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency insofar as such order was entered by reason of a determination by such appropriate regulatory agency pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)(2)(C)" edition="2015" range="78s(a)(2)(C) or 78s(b)(4)(C)" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a)(2)(C) or 78s(b)(4)(C) of this title</uscode> that such registration or proposed rule change would be inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds.</p>
