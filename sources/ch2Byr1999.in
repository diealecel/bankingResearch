<p class="note-body">This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “This Act”. The act was divided into two titles as follows: “Title I—Regulation of Securities Exchanges” and “Title II—Amendments to Securities Act of 1933.” This section was section 1 of title I, which title is set out as sections 78a to 78h, 78i to 78<em>l</em>, 78m to 78<em>o</em>, 78<em>o</em>–3 to 78dd–1, and 78ee to 78mm of this title. Title II of the act amended or repealed sections 77b to 77e, 77j, 77k, 77m, 77<em>o</em>, and 77s, and added former <uscode edition="1999" range="78ii and 78jj" section="78ii" title="15">sections 78ii and 78jj of this title</uscode>. Although these latter provisions were set out as a separate title, they were part of the act; hence, they are technically a part of the “Securities Exchange Act of 1934”.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the reasons hereinafter enumerated, transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are affected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and principal security holders, to require appropriate reports to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such transactions (a) are carried on in large volume by the public generally and in large part originate outside the States in which the exchanges and over-the-counter markets are located and/or are effected by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (b) constitute an important part of the current of interstate commerce; (c) involve in large part the securities of issuers engaged in interstate commerce; (d) involve the use of credit, directly affect the financing of trade, industry, and transportation in interstate commerce, and directly affect and influence the volume of interstate commerce; and affect the national credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The prices established and offered in such transactions are generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign countries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the prices at which securities are bought and sold, the amount of certain taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and the value of collateral for bank loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Frequently the prices of securities on such exchanges and markets are susceptible to manipulation and control, and the dissemination of such prices gives rise to excessive speculation, resulting in sudden and unreasonable fluctuations in the prices of securities which (a) cause alternately unreasonable expansion and unreasonable contraction of the volume of credit available for trade, transportation, and industry in interstate commerce, (b) hinder the proper appraisal of the value of securities and thus prevent a fair calculation of taxes <!-- PDFPage:170 -->owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and (c) prevent the fair valuation of collateral for bank loans and/or obstruct the effective operation of the national banking system and Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) National emergencies, which produce widespread unemployment and the dislocation of trade, transportation, and industry, and which burden interstate commerce and adversely affect the general welfare, are precipitated, intensified, and prolonged by manipulation and sudden and unreasonable fluctuations of security prices and by excessive speculation on such exchanges and markets, and to meet such emergencies the Federal Government is put to such great expense as to burden the national credit.</p>

<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Securities and Exchange Commission. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.</p>

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="556" title="5">section 556(b) of title 5</uscode>, or to authorize the delegation of the function of rulemaking as defined in subchapter II of <uscode chapter="5" edition="1999" title="5">chapter 5 of title 5</uscode>, with reference to general rules as distinguished from rules of particular applicability, or of the making of any rule pursuant to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(c) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right of review; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the delegation of any of its functions, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall retain a discretionary right to review the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, administrative law judge, employee, or employee board, upon its own initiative or upon petition of a party to or intervenor in such action, within such time and in such manner as the Commission by rule shall prescribe. The vote of one member of the Commission shall be sufficient to bring any such action before the Commission for review. A person or party shall be entitled to review by the Commission if he or it is adversely affected by action at a delegated level which (1) denies any request for action pursuant to section 77h(a) or <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="77h" title="15">section 77h(c) of this title</uscode> or the first sentence of section 78<em>l</em>(d) of this title; (2) suspends trading in a security pursuant to section 78<em>l</em>(k) of this title; or (3) is pursuant to any provision of this chapter in a case of adjudication, as defined in <uscode edition="1999" section="551" title="5">section 551 of title 5</uscode>, not required by this chapter to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in section 554(a)(1) through (6) of such title 5).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Finality of delegated action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the right to exercise such review is declined, or if no such review is sought within the time stated in the rules promulgated by the Commission, then the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, administrative law judge, employee, or employee board, shall, for all purposes, including appeal or review thereof, be deemed the action of the Commission.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration; application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exchange may be registered as a national securities exchange under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided in this section and in accordance with the provisions of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a) of this title</uscode>, by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the rules of the exchange and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination by Commission requisite to registration of applicant as a national securities exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exchange shall not be registered as a national securities exchange unless the Commission determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such exchange is so organized and has the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of this chapter and to comply, and (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="1999" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the rules of the exchange provide that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of such exchange and any person may become associated with a member thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The rules of the exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors shall be representative of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange, broker, or dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The rules of the exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and issuers and other persons using its facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The rules of the exchange are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this chapter or the administration of the exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The rules of the exchange provide that (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="1999" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) its members and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of the provisions of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, or the rules of the exchange, by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, being suspended or barred from being associated with a member, or any other fitting sanction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The rules of the exchange are in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, and in general, provide a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members, the denial of membership to any person seeking membership therein, the barring of any person from becoming associated with a member thereof, and the prohibition or limitation by the exchange of any person with respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The rules of the exchange do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The rules of the exchange prohibit the listing of any security issued in a limited partnership rollup transaction (as such term is defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of <uscode detail="(h)" edition="1999" section="78n" title="15">section 78n(h) of this title</uscode>), unless such transaction was conducted in accordance with procedures designed to protect the rights of limited partners, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the right of dissenting limited partners to one of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an appraisal and compensation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) retention of a security under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original issue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) approval of the limited partnership rollup transaction by not less than 75 percent of the outstanding securities of each of the participating limited partnerships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the use of a committee of limited partners that is independent, as determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the exchange, of the general partner or sponsor, that has been approved by a majority of the outstanding units of each of the participating limited partnerships, and that has such authority as is necessary to protect the interest of limited partners, including the authority to hire independent advisors, to negotiate with the general partner or sponsor on behalf of the limited partners, and to make a recommendation to the limited partners with respect to the proposed transaction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) other comparable rights that are prescribed by rule by the exchange and that are designed to protect dissenting limited partners;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<!-- PDFPage:195 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the right not to have their voting power unfairly reduced or abridged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the right not to bear an unfair portion of the costs of a proposed limited partnership rollup transaction that is rejected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) restrictions on the conversion of contingent interests or fees into non-contingent interests or fees and restrictions on the receipt of a non-contingent equity interest in exchange for fees for services which have not yet been provided.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">As used in this paragraph, the term “dissenting limited partner” means a person who, on the date on which soliciting material is mailed to investors, is a holder of a beneficial interest in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited partnership rollup transaction, and who casts a vote against the transaction and complies with procedures established by the exchange, except that for purposes of an exchange or tender offer, such person shall file an objection in writing under the rules of the exchange during the period during which the offer is outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Denial of membership in national exchanges; denial of association with member; conditions; limitation of membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A national securities exchange shall deny membership to (A) any person, other than a natural person, which is not a registered broker or dealer or (B) any natural person who is not, or is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A national securities exchange may, and in cases in which the Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny membership to any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer, and bar from becoming associated with a member any person, who is subject to a statutory disqualification. A national securities exchange shall file notice with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting any person to membership or permitting any person to become associated with a member, if the exchange knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that such person was subject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A national securities exchange may deny membership to, or condition the membership of, a registered broker or dealer if (i) such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of financial responsibility or operational capability or such broker or dealer or any natural person associated with such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) such broker or dealer or person associated with such broker or dealer has engaged and there is a reasonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a member and the natural persons associated with such an applicant in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A national securities exchange may bar a natural person from becoming a member or associated with a member, or condition the membership of a natural person or association of a natural person with a member, if such natural person (i) does not meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) has engaged and there is a reasonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange and require any person associated with a member, or any class of such persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with procedures so established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A national securities exchange may bar any person from becoming associated with a member if such person does not agree (i) to supply the exchange with such information with respect to its relationship and dealings with the member as may be specified in the rules of the exchange and (ii) to permit the examination of its books and records to verify the accuracy of any information so supplied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A national securities exchange may limit (A) the number of members of the exchange and (B) the number of members and designated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting as broker: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no national securities exchange shall have the authority to decrease the number of memberships in such exchange, or the number of members and designated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the floor of such exchange without the services of another person acting as broker, below such number in effect on May 1, 1975, or the date such exchange was registered with the Commission, whichever is later: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(c) of this title</uscode>, may amend the rules of any national securities exchange to increase (but not to decrease) or to remove any limitation on the number of memberships in such exchange or the number of members or designated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting as broker, if the Commission finds that such limitation imposes a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Discipline of national securities exchange members and persons associated with members; summary proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to determine whether a member or person associated with a member should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall bring specific charges, notify <!-- PDFPage:196 -->such member or person of, and give him an opportunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A determination by the exchange to impose a disciplinary sanction shall be supported by a statement setting forth—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any act or practice in which such member or person associated with a member has been found to have engaged, or which such member or person has been found to have omitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the specific provision of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, or the rules of the exchange which any such act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to determine whether a person shall be denied membership, barred from becoming associated with a member, or prohibited or limited with respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member thereof (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall notify such person of, and give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation under consideration and keep a record. A determination by the exchange to deny membership, bar a person from becoming associated with a member, or prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member thereof shall be supported by a statement setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national securities exchange may summarily (A) suspend a member or person associated with a member who has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization or barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in such financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines and so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be permitted to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors, creditors, other members, or the exchange, or (C) limit or prohibit any person with respect to access to services offered by the exchange if subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is applicable to such person or, in the case of a person who is not a member, if the exchange determines that such person does not meet the qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access and such person cannot be permitted to continue to have such access with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange. Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the exchange in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary action on its own motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments) that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Commissions, allowances, discounts, and other fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On and after June 4, 1975, no national securities exchange may impose any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members: <em>Provided, however</em>, That until May 1, 1976, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit any such exchange from imposing or fixing any schedule of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for acting as broker on the floor of the exchange or as odd-lot dealer: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(b) of this title</uscode> as modified by the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection, may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose a reasonable schedule or fix reasonable rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchange prior to November 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees are in the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchange after November 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees (i) are reasonable in relation to the costs of providing the service for which such fees are charged (and the Commission publishes the standards employed in adjudging reasonableness) and (ii) do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, taking into consideration the competitive effects of permitting such schedule or fixed rates weighed against the competitive effects of other lawful actions which the Commission is authorized to take under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(c) of this title</uscode>, the Commission, by rule, may abrogate any exchange rule which imposes a schedule or fixes rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees, if the Commission determines that such schedule or fixed rates are no longer reasonable, in the public interest, or necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before approving or disapproving any proposed rule change submitted by a national securities exchange which would impose a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchange, the Commission shall afford interested persons (i) an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, and arguments and (ii) with respect to any such rule concerning transactions effected after November 1, 1976, if the Commission determines there are disputed issues of material fact, to present such rebuttal submissions and to conduct (or have conducted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) such cross-examination as the <!-- PDFPage:197 -->Commission determines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of such disputed issues of material fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall prescribe rules and make rulings concerning any proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph designed to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules or rulings may (i) impose reasonable time limits on each interested person's oral presentations, and (ii) require any cross-examination to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to be conducted by the Commission on behalf of that person in such manner as the Commission determines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of disputed issues of material fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If any class of persons, the members of which are entitled to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and which have, in the view of the Commission, the same or similar interests in the proceeding, cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for purposes of cross-examination, the Commission may make rules and rulings specifying the manner in which such interests shall be represented and such cross-examination conducted.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rules and regulations for extension of credit; standard for initial extension; undermargined accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of preventing the excessive use of credit for the purchase or carrying of securities, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall, prior to October 1, 1934, and from time to time thereafter, prescribe rules and regulations with respect to the amount of credit that may be initially extended and subsequently maintained on any security (other than an exempted security). For the initial extension of credit, such rules and regulations shall be based upon the following standard: An amount not greater than whichever is the higher of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 55 per centum of the current market price of the security, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 100 per centum of the lowest market price of the security during the preceding thirty-six calendar months, but not more than 75 per centum of the current market price.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such rules and regulations may make appropriate provision with respect to the carrying of undermargined accounts for limited periods and under specified conditions; the withdrawal of funds or securities; the substitution or additional purchases of securities; the transfer of accounts from one lender to another; special or different margin requirements for delayed deliveries, short sales, arbitrage transactions, and securities to which paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply; the bases and the methods to be used in calculating loans, and margins and market prices; and similar administrative adjustments and details. For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection, until July 1, 1936, the lowest price at which a security has sold on or after July 1, 1933, shall be considered as the lowest price at which such security has sold during the preceding thirty-six calendar months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lower and higher margin requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Governors of the <!-- PDFPage:199 -->Federal Reserve System, may, from time to time, with respect to all or specified securities or transactions, or classes of securities, or classes of transactions, by such rules and regulations (1) prescribe such lower margin requirements for the initial extension or maintenance of credit as it deems necessary or appropriate for the accommodation of commerce and industry, having due regard to the general credit situation of the country, and (2) prescribe such higher margin requirements for the initial extension or maintenance of credit as it may deem necessary or appropriate to prevent the excessive use of credit to finance transactions in securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unlawful credit extension to customers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any member of a national securities exchange or any broker or dealer, directly or indirectly, to extend or maintain credit or arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to permit the extension or maintenance of credit in cases where the extension or maintenance of credit is not for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities or of evading or circumventing the provisions of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection and the rules and regulations issued under this subsection shall not apply to any credit extended, maintained, or arranged by a member of a national securities exchange or a broker or dealer to or for a member of a national securities exchange or a registered broker or dealer—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a substantial portion of whose business consists of transactions with persons other than brokers or dealers; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that the Board may impose such rules and regulations, in whole or in part, on any credit otherwise exempted by this paragraph if the Board determines that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unlawful credit extension in violation of rules and regulations; exceptions to application of rules, etc.</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any person not subject to subsection (c) of this section to extend or maintain credit or to arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any security, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Board shall prescribe to prevent the excessive use of credit for the purchasing or carrying of or trading in securities in circumvention of the other provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations may impose upon all loans made for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities limitations similar to those imposed upon members, brokers, or dealers by subsection (c) of this section and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§78j–1. Audit requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each audit required pursuant to this chapter of the financial statements of an issuer by an <!-- PDFPage:204 -->independent public accountant shall include, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures designed to identify related party transactions that are material to the financial statements or otherwise require disclosure therein; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern during the ensuing fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required response to audit discoveries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Investigation and report to management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the course of conducting an audit pursuant to this chapter to which subsection (a) of this section applies, the independent public accountant detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has or may have occurred, the accountant shall, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an illegal act has occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible effect of the illegal act on the financial statements of the issuer, including any contingent monetary effects, such as fines, penalties, and damages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate level of the management of the issuer and assure that the audit committee of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of such a committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of such accountant in the course of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly inconsequential.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Response to failure to take remedial action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after determining that the audit committee of the board of directors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of an audit committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of the accountant in the course of the audit of such accountant, the independent public accountant concludes that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the senior management has not taken, and the board of directors has not caused senior management to take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with respect to the illegal act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to take remedial action is reasonably expected to warrant departure from a standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the audit engagement;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the independent public accountant shall, as soon as practicable, directly report its conclusions to the board of directors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Commission; response to failure to notify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer whose board of directors receives a report under paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not later than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and shall furnish the independent public accountant making such report with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commission. If the independent public accountant fails to receive a copy of the notice before the expiration of the required 1-business-day period, the independent public accountant shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resign from the engagement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its report (or the documentation of any oral report given) not later than 1 business day following such failure to receive notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report after resignation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an independent public accountant resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), the accountant shall, not later than 1 business day following the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the accountant's report (or the documentation of any oral report given).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Auditor liability limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No independent public accountant shall be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, including any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a proceeding instituted pursuant to section 78u–3 of this title, that an independent public accountant has willfully violated paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may, in addition to entering an order under section 78u–3 of this title, impose a civil penalty against the independent public accountant and any other person that the Commission finds was a cause of such violation. The determination to impose a civil penalty and the amount of the penalty shall be governed by the standards set forth in section 78u–2 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preservation of existing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, nothing in this section shall be held to limit or otherwise affect the authority of the Commission under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) “Illegal act” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term “illegal act” means an act or omission that violates any law, or any rule or regulation having the force of law.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Trading for own account or account of associated person; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any member of a national securities exchange to effect any transaction on such exchange for its own account, the account of an associated person, or an account with respect to which it or an associated person thereof exercises investment discretion: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this paragraph shall not make unlawful—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any transaction by a dealer acting in the capacity of market maker;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any transaction for the account of an odd-lot dealer in a security in which he is so registered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any stabilizing transaction effected in compliance with rules under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="78j" title="15">section 78j(b) of this title</uscode> to facilitate a distribution of a security in which the member effecting such transaction is participating;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any bona fide arbitrage transaction, any bona fide hedge transaction involving a long or short position in an equity security and a long or short position in a security entitling the holder to acquire or sell such equity security, or any risk arbitrage transaction in connection with a merger, acquisition, tender offer, or similar transaction involving a recapitalization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any transaction for the account of a natural person, the estate of a natural person, or a trust created by a natural person for himself or another natural person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) any transaction to offset a transaction made in error;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) any other transaction for a member's own account provided that (i) such member is primarily engaged in the business of underwriting and distributing securities issued by other persons, selling securities to customers, and acting as broker, or any one or more of such activities, and whose gross income normally is derived principally from such business and related activities and (ii) such transaction is effected in compliance with rules of the Commission which, as a minimum, assure that the transaction is not inconsistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and yields priority, parity, and precedence in execution to orders for the account of persons who are not members or associated with members of the exchange;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) any transaction for an account with respect to which such member or an associated person thereof exercises investment discretion if such member—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has obtained, from the person or persons authorized to transact business for the account, express authorization for such member or associated person to effect such transactions prior to engaging in the practice of effecting such transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) furnishes the person or persons authorized to transact business for the account with a statement at least annually disclosing the aggregate compensation received by the exchange member in effecting such transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) complies with any rules the Commission has prescribed with respect to the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii); and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) any other transaction of a kind which the Commission, by rule, determines is consistent with the purposes of this paragraph, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to assure equal regulation of exchange markets and markets occurring otherwise than on an exchange, may regulate or prohibit:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) transactions on a national securities exchange not unlawful under paragraph (1) of this subsection effected by any member thereof for its own account (unless such member is acting in the capacity of market maker or odd-lot dealer), the account of an associated person, or an account with respect to which such member or an associated person thereof exercises investment discretion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transactions otherwise than on a national securities exchange effected by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce by any member of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer for the account of such member, broker, or dealer (unless such member, broker, or dealer is acting in the capacity of a market maker) <sup><a href="#78k_1_target" name="78k_1">1</a></sup> the account of an associated person, or an account with respect to which such member, broker, or dealer or associated person thereof exercises investment discretion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) transactions on a national securities exchange effected by any broker or dealer not a member thereof for the account of such broker or dealer (unless such broker or dealer is acting in the capacity of market maker), the account of an associated person, or an account with respect to which such broker or dealer or <!-- PDFPage:206 -->associated person thereof exercises investment discretion.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection insofar as they apply to transactions on a national securities exchange effected by a member thereof who was a member on February 1, 1978 shall not become effective until February 1, 1979. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to impair or limit the authority of the Commission to regulate or prohibit such transactions prior to February 1, 1979, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration of members as odd-lot dealers and specialists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When not in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national market system, the rules of a national securities exchange may permit (1) a member to be registered as an odd-lot dealer and as such to buy and sell for his own account so far as may be reasonably necessary to carry on such odd-lot transactions, and (2) a member to be registered as a specialist. Under the rules and regulations of the Commission a specialist may be permitted to act as a broker and dealer or limited to acting as a broker or dealer. It shall be unlawful for a specialist or an official of the exchange to disclose information in regard to orders placed with such specialist which is not available to all members of the exchange, to any person other than an official of the exchange, a representative of the Commission, or a specialist who may be acting for such specialist: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commission, by rule, may require disclosure to all members of the exchange of all orders placed with specialists, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. It shall also be unlawful for a specialist permitted to act as a broker and dealer to effect on the exchange as broker any transaction except upon a market or limited price order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions from provisions of section and rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If because of the limited volume of transactions effected on an exchange, it is in the opinion of the Commission impracticable and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to apply any of the foregoing provisions of this section or the rules and regulations thereunder, the Commission shall have power, upon application of the exchange and on a showing that the rules of such exchange are otherwise adequate for the protection of investors, to exempt such exchange and its members from any such provision or rules and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibition on extension of credit by broker-dealer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange who is both a dealer and a broker, or for any person who both as a broker and a dealer transacts a business in securities through the medium of a member or otherwise, to effect through the use of any facility of a national securities exchange or of the mails or of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise in the case of a member, (1) any transaction in connection with which, directly or indirectly, he extends or maintains or arranges for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for a customer on any security (other than an exempted security) which was a part of a new issue in the distribution of which he participated as a member of a selling syndicate or group within thirty days prior to such transaction: <em>Provided</em>, That credit shall not be deemed extended by reason of a bona fide delayed delivery of (i) any such security against full payment of the entire purchase price thereof upon such delivery within thirty-five days after such purchase or (ii) any mortgage related security or any small business related security against full payment of the entire purchase price thereof upon such delivery within one hundred and eighty days after such purchase, or within such shorter period as the Commission may prescribe by rule or regulation, or (2) any transaction with respect to any security (other than an exempted security) unless, if the transaction is with a customer, he discloses to such customer in writing at or before the completion of the transaction whether he is acting as a dealer for his own account, as a broker for such customer, or as a broker for some other person.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§78k–1. National market system for securities; securities information processors</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; facilitating establishment of national market system for securities; designation of qualified securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The securities markets are an important national asset which must be preserved and strengthened.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) New data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) It is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) economically efficient execution of securities transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the practicability of brokers executing investors’ orders in the best market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) an opportunity, consistent with the provisions of clauses (i) and (iv) of this subparagraph, for investors’ orders to be executed without the participation of a dealer.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities will foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investors’ orders, and contribute to best execution of such orders.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to use its authority under this chapter to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities (which may include subsystems for particular types of securities with unique trading characteristics) in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Commission, by rule, shall designate the securities or classes of securities qualified for trading in the national market system from among securities other than exempted securities. (Securities or classes of securities so designated hereinafter <sup><a href="#78k-1_1_target" name="78k-1_1">1</a></sup> in this section referred to as “qualified securities”.)</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission is authorized in furtherance of the directive in paragraph (2) of this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to create one or more advisory committees pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (which shall be in addition to the National Market Advisory Board established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section) and to employ one or more outside experts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by rule or order, to authorize or require self-regulatory organizations to act jointly with respect to matters as to which they share authority under this chapter in planning, developing, operating, or regulating a national market system (or a subsystem thereof) or one or more facilities thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to conduct studies and make recommendations to the Congress from time to time as to the possible need for modifications of the scheme of self-regulation provided for in this chapter so as to adapt it to a national market system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Securities information processors; registration; withdrawal of registration; access to services; censure; suspension or revocation of registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any securities information processor unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a securities information proc<!-- PDFPage:208 -->essor. The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any securities information processor or class of securities information processors or security or class of securities from any provision of this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, including the maintenance of fair and orderly markets in securities and the removal of impediments to and perfection of the mechanism of a national market system: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a securities information processor not acting as the exclusive processor of any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in securities is exempt from the requirement to register in accordance with this subsection unless the Commission, by rule or order, finds that the registration of such securities information processor is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or for the achievement of the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A securities information processor may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the address of its principal office, or offices, the names of the securities and markets for which it is then acting and for which it proposes to act as a securities information processor, and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe with regard to performance capability, standards and procedures for the collection, processing, distribution, and publication of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities, personnel qualifications, financial condition, and such other matters as the Commission determines to be germane to the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, or necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for registration pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, publish notice of the filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such application. Within ninety days of the date of the publication of such notice (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents) the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant such registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to sixty days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer periods as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant the registration of a securities information processor if the Commission finds that such securities information processor is so organized, and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable performance of its functions as a securities information processor, comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section, and, insofar as it is acting as an exclusive processor, operate fairly and efficiently. The Commission shall deny the registration of a securities information processor if the Commission does not make any such finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A registered securities information processor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered securities information processor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for registration, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If any registered securities information processor prohibits or limits any person in respect of access to services offered, directly or indirectly, by such securities information processor, the registered securities information processor shall promptly file notice thereof with the Commission. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Any prohibition or limitation on access to services with respect to which a registered securities information processor is required by this paragraph to file notice shall be subject to review by the Commission on its own motion, or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby filed within thirty days after such notice has been filed with the Commission and received by such aggrieved person, or within such longer period as the Commission may determine. Application to the Commission for review, or the institution of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of such prohibition or limitation, unless the Commission otherwise orders, summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments). The Commission shall establish for appropriate cases an expedited procedure for consideration and determination of the question of a stay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any proceeding to review the prohibition or limitation of any person in respect of access to services offered by a registered securities information processor, if the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such prohibition or limitation is consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder and that such person has not been discriminated against unfairly, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding or if it finds that such prohibition or limitation imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of <!-- PDFPage:209 -->the purposes of this chapter, the Commission, by order, shall set aside the prohibition or limitation and require the registered securities information processor to permit such person access to services offered by the registered securities information processor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission, by order, may censure or place limitations upon the activities, functions, or operations of any registered securities information processor or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or revoke the registration of any such processor, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest, necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to assure the prompt, accurate, or reliable performance of the functions of such securities information processor, and that such securities information processor has violated or is unable to comply with any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules and regulations covering use of mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce; reports of purchase or sale of qualified securities; limiting registered securities transactions to national securities exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No self-regulatory organization, member thereof, securities information processor, broker, or dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to collect, process, distribute, publish, or prepare for distribution or publication any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in any security other than an exempted security, to assist, participate in, or coordinate the distribution or publication of such information, or to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any such security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prevent the use, distribution, or publication of fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assure the prompt, accurate, reliable, and fair collection, processing, distribution, and publication of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities and the fairness and usefulness of the form and content of such information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) assure that all securities information processors may, for purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and reasonable terms such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is collected, processed, or prepared for distribution or publication by any exclusive processor of such information acting in such capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) assure that all exchange members, brokers, dealers, securities information processors, and, subject to such limitations as the Commission, by rule, may impose as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or maintenance of fair and orderly markets, all other persons may obtain on terms which are not unreasonably discriminatory such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is published or distributed by any self-regulatory organization or securities information processor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) assure that all exchange members, brokers, and dealers transmit and direct orders for the purchase or sale of qualified securities in a manner consistent with the establishment and operation of a national market system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) assure equal regulation of all markets for qualified securities and all exchange members, brokers, and dealers effecting transactions in such securities.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may require any person who has effected the purchase or sale of any qualified security by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to report such purchase or sale to a registered securities information processor, national securities exchange, or registered securities association and require such processor, exchange, or association to make appropriate distribution and publication of information with respect to such purchase or sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission, by rule, is authorized to prohibit brokers and dealers from effecting transactions in securities registered pursuant to section 78<em>l</em>(b) of this title otherwise than on a national securities exchange, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as a result of transactions in such securities effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange the fairness or orderliness of the markets for such securities has been affected in a manner contrary to the public interest or the protection of investors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no rule of any national securities exchange unreasonably impairs the ability of any dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such securities for his own account or unreasonably restricts competition among dealers in such securities or between dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists in such securities and such dealers who are not specialists in such securities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the maintenance or restoration of fair and orderly markets in such securities may not be assured through other lawful means under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any security or transaction or any class of securities or transactions from any such prohibition if the Commission deems such exemption consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in securities for his own account shall not be deemed to be unreasonably impaired by any rule of an exchange fairly and reasonably prescribing the sequence in which or<!-- PDFPage:210 -->ders brought to the exchange must be executed or which has been adopted to effect compliance with a rule of the Commission promulgated under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission is directed to review any and all rules of national securities exchanges which limit or condition the ability of members to effect transactions in securities otherwise than on such exchanges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No national securities exchange or registered securities association may limit or condition the participation of any member in any registered clearing agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) National Market Advisory Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than one hundred eighty days after June 4, 1975, the Commission shall establish a National Market Advisory Board (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Advisory Board”) to be composed of fifteen members, not all of whom shall be from the same geographical area of the United States, appointed by the Commission for a term specified by the Commission of not less than two years or more than five years. The Advisory Board shall consist of persons associated with brokers and dealers (who shall be a majority) and persons not so associated who are representative of the public and, to the extent feasible, have knowledge of the securities markets of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It shall be the responsibility of the Advisory Board to formulate and furnish to the Commission its views on significant regulatory proposals made by the Commission or any self-regulatory organization concerning the establishment, operation, and regulation of the markets for securities in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Advisory Board shall study and make recommendations to the Commission as to the steps it finds appropriate to facilitate the establishment of a national market system. In so doing, the Advisory Board shall assume the responsibilities of any advisory committee appointed to advise the Commission with respect to the national market system which is in existence at the time of the establishment of the Advisory Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Advisory Board shall study the possible need for modifications of the scheme of self-regulation provided for in this chapter so as to adapt it to a national market system, including the need for the establishment of a new self-regulatory organization (hereinafter in this section referred to as a “National Market Regulatory Board” or “Regulatory Board”) to administer the national market system. In the event the Advisory Board determines a National Market Regulatory Board should be established, it shall make recommendations as to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the point in time at which a Regulatory Board should be established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the composition of a Regulatory Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the scope of the authority of a Regulatory Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the relationship of a Regulatory Board to the Commission and to existing self-regulatory organizations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the manner in which a Regulatory Board should be funded.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Advisory Board shall report to the Congress, on or before December 31, 1976, the results of such study and its recommendations, including such recommendations for legislation as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In carrying out its responsibilities under this paragraph, the Advisory Board shall consult with self-regulatory organizations, brokers, dealers, securities information processors, issuers, investors, representatives of Government agencies, and other persons interested or likely to participate in the establishment, operation, or regulation of the national market system.</p>

If unlisted trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that security, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a national securities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. If the application is made to reinstate unlisted trading privileges to a security described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the Commission—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such security, the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such a security, and the desirability of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the national securities exchange making application under this subsection would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such security for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are not specialists.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration of all persons utilizing exchange facilities to effect transactions; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer which is either a person other than a natural person or a natural person not associated with a broker or dealer which is a person other than a natural person (other than such a broker or dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not make use of any facility of a national securities exchange) to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) unless such broker or dealer is registered in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (1) of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified in such rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Manner of registration of brokers and dealers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A broker or dealer may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such broker or dealer and any persons associated with such broker or dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within forty-five days of the date of the filing of such application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty days of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The order granting registration shall not be effective until such broker or dealer has become a member of a registered securities association, or until such broker or dealer has become a member of a national securities exchange if such broker or dealer effects transactions solely on that exchange, unless the Commission has exempted such broker or dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant such registration if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An application for registration of a broker or dealer to be formed or organized may be made by a broker or dealer to which the broker or dealer to be formed or organized is to be the successor. Such application, in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, shall contain such information and documents concerning the applicant, the successor, and any persons associated with the applicant or the successor, as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The grant or denial of registration to such an applicant shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Commission grants such registration, the registration shall terminate on the forty-fifth day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the successor shall, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, adopt the application for registration as its own.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person who is a broker or dealer solely by reason of acting as a municipal securities dealer or municipal securities broker, who so acts through a separately identifiable department or division, and who so acted in such a manner on June 4, 1975, may, in accordance with <!-- PDFPage:231 -->such terms and conditions as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, register such separately identifiable department or division in accordance with this subsection. If any such department or division is so registered, the department or division and not such person himself shall be the broker or dealer for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within six months of the date of the granting of registration to a broker or dealer, the Commission, or upon the authorization and direction of the Commission, a registered securities association or national securities exchange of which such broker or dealer is a member, shall conduct an inspection of the broker or dealer to determine whether it is operating in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commission may delay such inspection of any class of brokers or dealers for a period not to exceed six months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any provision of this chapter (other than <uscode edition="1999" section="78e" title="15">section 78e of this title</uscode> and subsection (a) of this section) which prohibits any act, practice, or course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also prohibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any registered broker or dealer or any person acting on behalf of such a broker or dealer, irrespective of any use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any broker or dealer if it finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest and that such broker or dealer, whether prior or subsequent to becoming such, or any person associated with such broker or dealer, whether prior or subsequent to becoming so associated—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has willfully made or caused to be made in any application for registration or report required to be filed with the Commission or with any other appropriate regulatory agency under this chapter, or in any proceeding before the Commission with respect to registration, any statement which was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any such application or report any material fact which is required to be stated therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has been convicted within ten years preceding the filing of any application for registration or at any time thereafter of any felony or misdemeanor or of a substantially equivalent crime by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction which the Commission finds—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) involves the purchase or sale of any security, the taking of a false oath, the making of a false report, bribery, perjury, burglary, any substantially equivalent activity however denominated by the laws of the relevant foreign government, or conspiracy to commit any such offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) arises out of the conduct of the business of a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, bank, insurance company, fiduciary, transfer agent, foreign person performing a function substantially equivalent to any of the above, or entity or person required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (<uscode edition="1999" section="1" title="7">7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.</uscode>) or any substantially equivalent foreign statute or regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) involves the larceny, theft, robbery, extortion, forgery, counterfeiting, fraudulent concealment, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of funds, or securities, or substantially equivalent activity however denominated by the laws of the relevant foreign government; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) has willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any other person of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commodity Exchange Act, this chapter, the rules or regulations under any of such statutes, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or has failed reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing violations of the provisions of such statutes, rules, and regulations, another person who commits such a violation, if such other person is subject to his supervision. For the purposes of this subparagraph (E) no person shall be deemed to have failed reasonably to supervise any other person, if—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:232 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) there have been established procedures, and a system for applying such procedures, which would reasonably be expected to prevent and detect, insofar as practicable, any such violation by such other person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such person has reasonably discharged the duties and obligations incumbent upon him by reason of such procedures and system without reasonable cause to believe that such procedures and system were not being complied with.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) has been found by a foreign financial regulatory authority to have—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) made or caused to be made in any application for registration or report required to be filed with a foreign financial regulatory authority, or in any proceeding before a foreign financial regulatory authority with respect to registration, any statement that was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any application or report to the foreign financial regulatory authority any material fact that is required to be stated therein;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Pending final determination whether any registration under this subsection shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Any registered broker or dealer may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered broker or dealer is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker or dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration of such broker or dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) With respect to any person who is associated, who is seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was associated or was seeking to become associated with a broker or dealer, or any person participating, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was participating, in an offering of any penny stock, the Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities or functions of such person, or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar such person from being associated with a broker or dealer, or from participating in an offering of penny stock, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person—</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It shall be unlawful—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for any person as to whom an order under subparagraph (A) is in effect, without the consent of the Commission, willfully to become, or to be, associated with a broker or dealer in contravention of such order, or to participate in an offering of penny stock in contravention of such order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for any broker or dealer to permit such a person, without the consent of the Commission, to become or remain, a person associated with the broker or dealer in contravention of such order, if such broker or dealer knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such order; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) for any broker or dealer to permit such a person, without the consent of the Commission, to participate in an offering of penny stock in contravention of such order, if such broker or dealer knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such order and of such participation.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “person participating in an offering of penny stock” includes any person acting as any promoter, finder, consultant, agent, or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. The Commission may, by rule or regulation, define such term to include other activities, and may, by rule, regulation, or order, exempt any person or class of persons, in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally, from such term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No registered broker or dealer or government securities broker or government securities dealer registered (or required to register) under section 78<em>o</em>–5(a)(1)(A) of this title shall effect any transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, any security unless such broker or deal<!-- PDFPage:233 -->er meets such standards of operational capability and such broker or dealer and all natural persons associated with such broker or dealer meet such standards of training, experience, competence, and such other qualifications as the Commission finds necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The Commission shall establish such standards by rules and regulations, which may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify that all or any portion of such standards shall be applicable to any class of brokers and dealers and persons associated with brokers and dealers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require persons in any such class to pass tests prescribed in accordance with such rules and regulations, which tests shall, with respect to any class of partners, officers, or supervisory employees (which latter term may be defined by the Commission's rules and regulations and as so defined shall include branch managers of brokers or dealers) engaged in the management of the broker or dealer, include questions relating to bookkeeping, accounting, internal control over cash and securities, supervision of employees, maintenance of records, and other appropriate matters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide that persons in any such class other than brokers and dealers and partners, officers, and supervisory employees of brokers or dealers, may be qualified solely on the basis of compliance with such standards of training and such other qualifications as the Commission finds appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission, by rule, may prescribe reasonable fees and charges to defray its costs in carrying out this paragraph, including, but not limited to, fees for any test administered by it or under its direction. The Commission may cooperate with registered securities associations and national securities exchanges in devising and administering tests and may require registered brokers and dealers and persons associated with such brokers and dealers to pass tests administered by or on behalf of any such association or exchange and to pay such association or exchange reasonable fees or charges to defray the costs incurred by such association or exchange in administering such tests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) It shall be unlawful for any registered broker or dealer to effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than or <sup><a href="#78o_1_target" name="78o_1">1</a></sup> commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills), unless such broker or dealer is a member of a securities association registered pursuant to section 78<em>o</em>–3 of this title or effects transactions in securities solely on a national securities exchange of which it is a member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Commission by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (8) of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified in such rule or order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commission shall, prior to adopting any rule or regulation under subparagraph (C), consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury and each appropriate regulatory agency. If the Secretary of the Treasury or any appropriate regulatory agency comments in writing on a proposed rule or regulation of the Commission under such subparagraph (C) that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before adopting the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule or regulation, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule or regulation, find that such rule or regulation is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary's determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No broker or dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which it is a member, in connection with which such broker or dealer engages in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act or practice, or makes any fictitious quotation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Commission shall, for the purposes of this paragraph, by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative and such quotations as are fictitious.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commission shall, prior to adopting any rule or regulation under subparagraph (C), consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury and each appropriate regulatory agency. If the Secretary of the Treasury or any appropriate regulatory agency comments in writing on a proposed rule or regulation of the Commission under such subparagraph (C) that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before adopting the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule or regulation, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule or regulation, find that such rule or regulation is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary's determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No broker or dealer (other than a government securities broker or government securities dealer, except a registered broker or dealer) shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security (except a government security) or commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to provide safeguards with respect to the financial responsibility and related practices of brokers and dealers including, but not limited to, the acceptance of custody and use of customers’ securities and the carrying and use of customers’ deposits or credit balances. Such rules and regulations shall (A) require the maintenance of reserves with respect to customers’ deposits or credit balances, and (B) no later than September 1, 1975, establish minimum financial responsibility requirements for all brokers and dealers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that any person subject to the provisions of section 78<em>l</em>, 78m, 78n of this title or subsection (d) of this section or any rule or regulation thereunder has failed to comply with any such provision, rule, or regulation in any material respect, the Commission may publish its findings and issue an order requiring such person, and any person who was a cause of the failure to comply due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to the failure to comply, to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision or such rule or regulation thereunder upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Commission may specify in such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No dealer (other than a specialist registered on a national securities exchange) acting in the capacity of market maker or otherwise shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or a municipal security) in contravention of such specified and appropriate standards with respect to dealing as the Commission, by rule, shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national market system.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed (A) to affect the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, pursuant to <uscode edition="1999" section="78g" title="15">section 78g of this title</uscode>, to prescribe rules and regulations for the purpose of preventing the excessive use of credit for the purchase or carrying of securities, or (B) to authorize the Commission to prescribe rules or regulations for such purpose.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Filing of supplementary and periodic information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each issuer which has filed a registration statement containing an undertaking which is or becomes operative under this subsection as in effect prior to August 20, 1964, and each issuer which shall after such date file a registration statement which has become effective pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended [<uscode edition="1999" section="77a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.</uscode>], shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, such supplementary and periodic information, documents, and reports as may be required pursuant to <uscode edition="1999" section="78m" title="15">section 78m of this title</uscode> in respect of a security registered pursuant to section 78<em>l</em> of this title. The duty to file under this subsection shall be automatically suspended if and so long as any issue of securities of such issuer is registered pursuant to section 78<em>l</em> of this title. The duty to file under this subsection shall also be automatically suspended as to any fiscal year, other than the fiscal year within which such registration statement became effective, if, at the beginning of such fiscal year, the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates are held of record by less than three hundred persons. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “class” shall be construed to include all securities of an issuer which are of substantially similar character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar rights and privileges. The Commission may, for the purpose of this subsection, define by rules and regulations the term “held of record” as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors in order to prevent circumvention of the provisions of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall apply to securities issued by a foreign government or political subdivision thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compliance with this chapter by members not required to be registered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rule, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors or to assure equal regulation, may require any member of a national securities exchange not required to register under this section and any person associated with any such member to comply with any provision of this chapter (other than subsection (a) of this section) or the rules or regulations thereunder which by its terms regulates or prohibits any act, practice, or course of business by a “broker or dealer” or “registered broker or dealer” or a “person associated with a broker or dealer,” respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prevention of misuse of material, nonpublic information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every registered broker or dealer shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of such broker's or dealer's business, to prevent the misuse in violation of this chapter, or the rules or regulations thereunder, of material, nonpublic information by such broker or dealer or any person associated with such broker or dealer.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commission rules relating to disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall adopt rules setting forth additional standards for the disclosure by brokers and dealers to customers of information concerning transactions in penny stocks. Such rules—</p>

Such exemptions shall include an exemption for brokers and dealers based on the minimal percentage of the broker's or dealer's commissions, commission-equivalents, and markups received from transactions in penny stocks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any person to violate such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to maintain fair and orderly markets—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as necessary or appropriate to carry out this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts and practices with respect to penny stocks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitations on State law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital, margin, books and records, bonding, and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No law, rule, regulation, or order, or other administrative action of any State or political subdivision thereof shall establish capital, custody, margin, financial responsibility, making and keeping records, bonding, or financial or operational reporting requirements for brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers, or government securities dealers that differ from, or are in addition to, the requirements in those areas established under this chapter. The Commission shall consult periodically the securities commissions (or any agency or office performing like functions) of the States concerning the adequacy of such requirements as established under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) De minimis transactions by associated persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No law, rule, regulation, or order, or other administrative action of any State or political subdivision thereof may prohibit an associated person of a broker or dealer from effecting a transaction described in paragraph (3) for a customer in such State if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) to which the customer was assigned for 14 days prior to the day of the transaction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) who is registered with a State in which the customer was a resident or was present for at least 30 consecutive days during the 1-year period prior to the day of the transaction; or</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transaction is effected—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) on behalf of a customer that, for 30 days prior to the day of the transaction, maintained an account with the broker or dealer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) during the period beginning on the date on which such associated person files an application for registration with the State in which the transaction is effected and ending on the earlier of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) 60 days after the date on which the application is filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the date on which such State notifies the associated person that it has denied the application for registration or has stayed the pendency of the application for cause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each of up to 3 associated persons of a broker or dealer who are designated to <!-- PDFPage:237 -->effect transactions during the absence or unavailability of the principal associated person for a customer may be treated as an associated person to which such customer is assigned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the customer is present in another State for 30 or more consecutive days or has permanently changed his or her residence to another State, a transaction is not described in this paragraph, unless the associated person of the broker or dealer files an application for registration with such State not later than 10 business days after the later of the date of the transaction, or the date of the discovery of the presence of the customer in the other State for 30 or more consecutive days or the change in the customer's residence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rulemaking to extend requirements to new hybrid products</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to commencing a rulemaking under this subsection, the Commission shall consult with and seek the concurrence of the Board concerning the imposition of broker or dealer registration requirements with respect to any new hybrid product. In developing and promulgating rules under this subsection, the Commission shall consider the views of the Board, including views with respect to the nature of the new hybrid product; the history, purpose, extent, and appropriateness of the regulation of the new product under the Federal banking laws; and the impact of the proposed rule on the banking industry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall not—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require a bank to register as a broker or dealer under this section because the bank engages in any transaction in, or buys or sells, a new hybrid product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bring an action against a bank for a failure to comply with a requirement described in subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">unless the Commission has imposed such requirement by rule or regulation issued in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Criteria for rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall not impose a requirement under paragraph (2) of this subsection with respect to any new hybrid product unless the Commission determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the new hybrid product is a security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) imposing such requirement is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (3), the Commission shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature of the new hybrid product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the history, purpose, extent, and appropriateness of the regulation of the new hybrid product under the Federal securities laws and under the Federal banking laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Objection to Commission regulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Filing of petition for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may obtain review of any final regulation described in paragraph (2) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by filing in such court, not later than 60 days after the date of publication of the final regulation, a written petition requesting that the regulation be set aside. Any proceeding to challenge any such rule shall be expedited by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transmittal of petition and record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A copy of a petition described in subparagraph (A) shall be transmitted as soon as possible by the Clerk of the Court to an officer or employee of the Commission designated for that purpose. Upon receipt of the petition, the Commission shall file with the court the regulation under review and any documents referred to therein, and any other relevant materials prescribed by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exclusive jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On the date of the filing of the petition under subparagraph (A), the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the materials set forth in subparagraph (B), to affirm and enforce or to set aside the regulation at issue.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Standard of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall determine to affirm and enforce or set aside a regulation of the Commission under this subsection, based on the determination of the court as to whether—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the subject product is a new hybrid product, as defined in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the subject product is a security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) imposing a requirement to register as a broker or dealer for banks engaging in transactions in such product is appropriate in light of the history, purpose, and extent of regulation under the Federal securities laws and under the Federal banking laws, giving deference neither to the views of the Commission nor the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Judicial stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The filing of a petition by the Board pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall operate as a judicial stay, until the date on which the determination of the court is final (including any appeal of such determination).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Other authority to challenge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any aggrieved party may seek judicial review of the Commission's rulemaking under this subsection pursuant to <uscode edition="1999" section="78y" title="15">section 78y of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) New hybrid product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term “new hybrid product” means a product that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was not subjected to regulation by the Commission as a security prior to the date of the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act [Nov. 12, 1999];</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) Protecting investors in new securities is a critical component in the maintenance of an honest and healthy market for such securities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) Protecting issuers of new securities and promoting the capital formation process on behalf of small companies are fundamental concerns in maintaining a strong economy and viable trading markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) Unscrupulous market practices and market participants have pervaded the ‘penny stock’ market with an overwhelming amount of fraud and abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) Although the Securities and Exchange Commission, State securities regulators, and securities self-regulators have made efforts to curb these abusive and harmful practices, the penny stock market still lacks an adequate and sufficient regulatory structure, particularly in comparison to the structure for overseeing trading in National Market System securities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) Investors in the penny stock market suffer from a serious lack of adequate information concerning price and volume of penny stock transactions, the nature of this market, and the specific securities in which they are investing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) Current practices do not adequately regulate the role of ‘promoters’ and ‘consultants’ in the penny stock market, and many professionals who have been banned from the securities markets have ended up in promoter and consultant roles, contributing substantially to fraudulent and abusive schemes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) The present regulatory environment has permitted the ascendancy of the use of particular market practices, such as ‘reverse mergers’ with shell corporations and ‘blank check’ offerings, which are used to facilitate manipulation schemes and harm investors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) In light of the substantial and continuing problems in the penny stock markets, additional legislative measures are necessary and appropriate.”</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The rules of the association are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, to fix minimum profits, to impose any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this chapter or the administration of the association.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration of municipal securities dealers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any municipal securities dealer (other than one registered as a broker or dealer under section 78<em>o</em> of this title) to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security unless such municipal securities dealer is registered in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A municipal securities dealer may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such municipal securities dealer and any persons associated with such municipal securities dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within forty-five days of the date of the filing of such application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty days of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant the registration of a municipal securities dealer if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any provision of this chapter (other than <uscode edition="1999" section="78e" title="15">section 78e of this title</uscode> or paragraph (1) of this subsection) which prohibits any act, practice, or course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also prohibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any registered municipal securities dealer or any person acting on behalf of such municipal securities dealer, irrespective of any use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer or class of brokers, dealers, or municipal securities dealers from any provision of this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:249 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board; rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than one hundred twenty days after June 4, 1975, the Commission shall establish a Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Board”), to be composed initially of fifteen members appointed by the Commission, which shall perform the duties set forth in this section. The initial members of the Board shall serve as members for a term of two years, and shall consist of (A) five individuals who are not associated with any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (other than by reason of being under common control with, or indirectly controlling, any broker or dealer which is not a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer), at least one of whom shall be representative of investors in municipal securities, and at least one of whom shall be representative of issuers of municipal securities (which members are hereinafter referred to as “public representatives”); (B) five individuals who are associated with and representative of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers which are not banks or subsidiaries or departments or divisions of banks (which members are hereinafter referred to as “broker-dealer representatives”); and (C) five individuals who are associated with and representative of municipal securities dealers which are banks or subsidiaries or departments or divisions of banks (which members are hereinafter referred to as “bank representatives”). Prior to the expiration of the terms of office of the initial members of the Board, an election shall be held under rules adopted by the Board (pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section) of the members to succeed such initial members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall propose and adopt rules to effect the purposes of this chapter with respect to transactions in municipal securities effected by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. (Such rules are hereinafter collectively referred to in this chapter as “rules of the Board”.) The rules of the Board, as a minimum, shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide that no municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security unless such municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer meets such standards of operational capability and such municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer and every natural person associated with such municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer meet such standards of training, experience, competence, and such other qualifications as the Board finds necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. In connection with the definition and application of such standards the Board may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) appropriately classify municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers (taking into account relevant matters, including types of business done, nature of securities other than municipal securities sold, and character of business organization), and persons associated with municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) specify that all or any portion of such standards shall be applicable to any such class;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) require persons in any such class to pass tests administered in accordance with subsection (c)(7) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) provide that persons in any such class other than municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers and partners, officers, and supervisory employees of municipal securities brokers or municipal securities dealers, may be qualified solely on the basis of compliance with such standards of training and such other qualifications as the Board finds appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish fair procedures for the nomination and election of members of the Board and assure fair representation in such nominations and elections of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers. Such rules shall provide that the membership of the Board shall at all times be equally divided among public representatives, broker-dealer representatives, and bank representatives, and that the public representatives shall be subject to approval by the Commission to assure that no one of them is associated with any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (other than by reason of being under common control with, or indirectly controlling, any broker or dealer which is not a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer) and that at least one is representative of investors in municipal securities and at least one is representative of issuers of municipal securities. Such rules shall also specify the term members shall serve and may increase the number of members which shall constitute the whole Board provided that such number is an odd number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, municipal securities brokers, or municipal securities dealers, to fix minimum profits, to impose any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by municipal securities brokers or municipal securities dealers, to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this chapter or the administration of the Board, or to impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) if the Board deems appropriate, provide for the arbitration of claims, disputes, and controversies relating to transactions in municipal securities: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no person other than a municipal securities <!-- PDFPage:250 -->broker, municipal securities dealer, or person associated with such a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer may be compelled to submit to such arbitration except at his instance and in accordance with <uscode edition="1999" section="78cc" title="15">section 78cc of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provide for the periodic examination in accordance with subsection (c)(7) of this section of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers to determine compliance with applicable provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the Board. Such rules shall specify the minimum scope and frequency of such examinations and shall be designed to avoid unnecessary regulatory duplication or undue regulatory burdens for any such municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) include provisions governing the form and content of quotations relating to municipal securities which may be distributed or published by any municipal securities broker, municipal securities dealer, or person associated with such a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer, and the persons to whom such quotations may be supplied. Such rules relating to quotations shall be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) prescribe records to be made and kept by municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) define the term “separately identifiable department or division”, as that term is used in <uscode detail="(a)(30)" edition="1999" section="78c" title="15">section 78c(a)(30) of this title</uscode>, in accordance with specified and appropriate standards to assure that a bank is not deemed to be engaged in the business of buying and selling municipal securities through a separately identifiable department or division unless such department or division is organized and administered so as to permit independent examination and enforcement of applicable provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the Board. A separately identifiable department or division of a bank may be engaged in activities other than those relating to municipal securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) provide for the operation and administration of the Board, including the selection of a Chairman from among the members of the Board, the compensation of the members of the Board, and the appointment and compensation of such employees, attorneys, and consultants as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the Board's functions under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) provide that each municipal securities broker and each municipal securities dealer shall pay to the Board such reasonable fees and charges as may be necessary or appropriate to defray the costs and expenses of operating and administering the Board. Such rules shall specify the amount of such fees and charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) establish the terms and conditions under which any municipal securities dealer may sell, or prohibit any municipal securities dealer from selling, any part of a new issue of municipal securities to a municipal securities investment portfolio during the underwriting period.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commission under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discipline of municipal securities dealers; censure; suspension or revocation of registration; other sanctions; investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security in contravention of any rule of the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations, suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any municipal securities dealer, if it finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, denial, suspension, or revocation, is in the public interest and that such municipal securities dealer has committed or omitted any act or omission enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section 78<em>o</em>(b) of this title, has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) within ten years of the commencement of the proceedings under this paragraph, or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Pending final determination whether any registration under this section shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Any registered municipal securities dealer may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may deem necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered municipal securities dealer is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a municipal securities dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration of such municipal securities dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission, by order, shall censure or place limitations on the activities or functions of any person associated, seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, associated or seeking to become associated with a municipal securities dealer, or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or bar any such person from being associated with a municipal securities dealer, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person has committed any act or omission enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section 78<em>o</em>(b) of this title, has been convicted of <!-- PDFPage:251 -->any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) within 10 years of the commencement of the proceedings under this paragraph, or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph (4). It shall be unlawful for any person as to whom an order entered pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (5) of this subsection suspending or barring him from being associated with a municipal securities dealer is in effect willfully to become, or to be, associated with a municipal securities dealer without the consent of the Commission, and it shall be unlawful for any municipal securities dealer to permit such a person to become, or remain, a person associated with him without the consent of the Commission, if such municipal securities dealer knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to any municipal securities dealer for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, the appropriate regulatory agency for such municipal securities dealer may sanction any such municipal securities dealer in the manner and for the reasons specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection and any person associated with such municipal securities dealer in the manner and for the reasons specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection. In addition, such appropriate regulatory agency may, in accordance with <uscode edition="1999" section="1818" title="12">section 1818 of title 12</uscode>, enforce compliance by such municipal securities dealer or any person associated with such municipal securities dealer with the provisions of this section, <uscode edition="1999" section="78q" title="15">section 78q of this title</uscode>, the rules of the Board, and the rules of the Commission pertaining to municipal securities dealers, persons associated with municipal securities dealers, and transactions in municipal securities. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any violation of any such provision shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of any order under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" range="1818(b) or 1818(c)" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(b) or 1818(c) of title 12</uscode>, and the customers of any such municipal securities dealer shall be deemed to be “depositors” as that term is used in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(c) of title 12</uscode>. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such appropriate regulatory agency to proceed against such municipal securities dealer under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Commission, prior to the entry of an order of investigation, or commencement of any proceedings, against any municipal securities dealer, or person associated with any municipal securities dealer, for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, for violation of any provision of this section, section 78<em>o</em>(c)(1) or 78<em>o</em>(c)(2) of this title, any rule or regulation under any such section, or any rule of the Board, shall (i) give notice to the appropriate regulatory agency for such municipal securities dealer of the identity of such municipal securities dealer or person associated with such municipal securities dealer, the nature of and basis for such proposed action, and whether the Commission is seeking a monetary penalty against such municipal securities dealer or such associated person pursuant to section 78u–2 of this title; and (ii) consult with such appropriate regulatory agency concerning the effect of such proposed action on sound banking practices and the feasibility and desirability of coordinating such action with any proceeding or proposed proceeding by such appropriate regulatory agency against such municipal securities dealer or associated person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The appropriate regulatory agency for a municipal securities dealer (if other than the Commission), prior to the entry of an order of investigation, or commencement of any proceedings, against such municipal securities dealer or person associated with such municipal securities dealer, for violation of any provision of this section, the rules of the Board, or the rules or regulations of the Commission pertaining to municipal securities dealers, persons associated with municipal securities dealers, or transactions in municipal securities shall (i) give notice to the Commission of the identity of such municipal securities dealer or person associated with such municipal securities dealer and the nature of and basis for such proposed action and (ii) consult with the Commission concerning the effect of such proposed action on the protection of investors and the feasibility and desirability of coordinating such action with any proceeding or proposed proceeding by the Commission against such municipal securities dealer or associated person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to impair or limit (other than by the requirement of prior consultation) the power of the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency for a municipal securities dealer to initiate any action of a class described in this paragraph or to affect in any way the power of the Commission or such appropriate regulatory agency to initiate any other action pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Tests required pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(A)(iii) of this section shall be administered by or on behalf of and periodic examinations pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section shall be conducted by—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a registered securities association, in the case of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers who are members of such association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the appropriate regulatory agency for any municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer, in the case of all other municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A registered securities association shall make a report of any examination conducted pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section and promptly furnish the Commission a copy thereof and any data supplied to it in connection with such examination. Subject to such limitations as the Commission, by rule, determines to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission shall, on request, make available to the Board a copy of any report of an examination of a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer made by or furnished to the Commission pursuant to this paragraph or <uscode detail="(c)(3)" edition="1999" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(c)(3) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Commission is authorized, by order, if in its opinion such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection <!-- PDFPage:252 -->of investors, or otherwise, in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, to remove from office or censure any member or employee of the Board, who, the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, has willfully (A) violated any provision of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, or the rules of the Board or (B) abused his authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of municipal securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Neither the Commission nor the Board is authorized under this chapter, by rule or regulation, to require any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectly through a purchaser or prospective purchaser of securities from the issuer, to file with the Commission or the Board prior to the sale of such securities by the issuer any application, report, or document in connection with the issuance, sale, or distribution of such securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board is not authorized under this chapter to require any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectly through a municipal securities broker or municipal securities dealer or otherwise, to furnish to the Board or to a purchaser or a prospective purchaser of such securities any application, report, document, or information with respect to such issuer: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Board may require municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers to furnish to the Board or purchasers or prospective purchasers of municipal securities applications, reports, documents, and information with respect to the issuer thereof which is generally available from a source other than such issuer.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration requirements; notice to regulatory agencies; manner of registration; exemption from registration requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any government securities broker or government securities dealer (other than a registered broker or dealer or a financial institution) to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any government security unless such government securities broker or government securities dealer is registered in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) It shall be unlawful for any government securities broker or government securities dealer that is a registered broker or dealer or a financial institution to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any government security unless such government securities broker or government securities dealer has filed with the appropriate regulatory agency written notice that it is a government securities <!-- PDFPage:253 -->broker or government securities dealer. When such a government securities broker or government securities dealer ceases to act as such it shall file with the appropriate regulatory agency a written notice that it is no longer acting as a government securities broker or government securities dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Such notices shall be in such form and contain such information concerning a government securities broker or government securities dealer that is a financial institution and any persons associated with such government securities broker or government securities dealer as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall, by rule, after consultation with each appropriate regulatory agency (including the Commission), prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Such notices shall be in such form and contain such information concerning a government securities broker or government securities dealer that is a registered broker or dealer and any persons associated with such government securities broker or government securities dealer as the Commission shall, by rule, prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Each appropriate regulatory agency (other than the Commission) shall make available to the Commission the notices which have been filed with it under this subparagraph, and the Commission shall maintain and make available to the public such notices and the notices it receives under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A government securities broker or a government securities dealer subject to the registration requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such government securities broker or government securities dealer and any persons associated with such government securities broker or government securities dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within 45 days of the date of filing of such application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by order grant registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within 120 days of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The order granting registration shall not be effective until such government securities broker or government securities dealer has become a member of a national securities exchange registered under <uscode edition="1999" section="78f" title="15">section 78f of this title</uscode>, or a securities association registered under section 78<em>o</em>–3 of this title, unless the Commission has exempted such government securities broker or government securities dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The Commission may extend the time for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to 90 days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant the registration of a government securities broker or a government securities dealer if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any provision of this chapter (other than <uscode edition="1999" section="78e" title="15">section 78e of this title</uscode> or paragraph (1) of this subsection) which prohibits any act, practice, or course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also prohibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any government securities broker or government securities dealer registered or having filed notice under paragraph (1) of this subsection or any person acting on behalf of such government securities broker or government securities dealer, irrespective of any use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No government securities broker or government securities dealer that is required to register under paragraph (1)(A) and that is not a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation shall effect any transaction in any security in contravention of such rules as the Commission shall prescribe pursuant to this subsection to assure that its customers receive complete, accurate, and timely disclosure of the inapplicability of Securities Investor Protection Corporation coverage to their accounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Secretary”), by rule or order, upon the Secretary's own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any government securities broker or government securities dealer, or class of government securities brokers or government securities dealers, from any provision of subsection (a), (b), or (d) of this section, other than subsection (d)(3) of this section, or the rules thereunder, if the Secretary finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules with respect to transactions in government securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall propose and adopt rules to effect the purposes of this chapter with respect to transactions in government securities effected by government securities brokers and government securities dealers as follows:</p>

<!-- PDFPage:254 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such rules shall require every government securities broker and government securities dealer to make reports to and furnish copies of records to the appropriate regulatory agency, and to file with the appropriate regulatory agency, annually or more frequently, a balance sheet and income statement certified by an independent public accountant, prepared on a calendar or fiscal year basis, and such other financial statements (which shall, as the Secretary specifies, be certified) and information concerning its financial condition as required by such rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Such rules shall require records to be made and kept by government securities brokers and government securities dealers and shall specify the periods for which such records shall be preserved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Obligations to obtain, maintain, and report information</cap-smallcap>.—Every person who is registered as a government securities broker or government securities dealer under this section shall obtain such information and make and keep such records as the Secretary by rule prescribes concerning the registered person's policies, procedures, or systems for monitoring and controlling financial and operational risks to it resulting from the activities of any of its associated persons, other than a natural person. Such records shall describe, in the aggregate, each of the financial and securities activities conducted by, and customary sources of capital and funding of, those of its associated persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of such registered person, including its capital, its liquidity, or its ability to conduct or finance its operations. The Secretary, by rule, may require summary reports of such information to be filed with the registered person's appropriate regulatory agency no more frequently than quarterly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authority to require additional information</cap-smallcap>.—If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or other available information, the appropriate regulatory agency reasonably concludes that it has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of any government securities broker or government securities dealer registered under this section, such agency may require the registered person to make reports concerning the financial and securities activities of any of such person's associated persons, other than a natural person, whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of such registered person. The appropriate regulatory agency, in requiring reports pursuant to this subparagraph, shall specify the information required, the period for which it is required, the time and date on which the information must be furnished, and whether the information is to be furnished directly to the appropriate regulatory agency or to a self-regulatory organization with primary responsibility for examining the registered person's financial and operational condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Special provisions with respect to associated persons subject to federal banking agency regulation.—</cap-smallcap></p>

The Secretary shall, at the request of a Federal banking agency, publish such comment and response in the Federal Register at the time of publishing the adopted rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Use of banking agency reports</cap-smallcap>.—A registered government securities broker or government securities dealer shall be in compliance with any recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph concerning an associated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency if such government securities broker or government securities dealer utilizes for such recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports filed by the associated person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to <uscode edition="1999" section="161" title="12">section 161 of title 12</uscode>, subchapter VIII of <uscode chapter="3" edition="1999" title="12">chapter 3 of title 12</uscode>, <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="1817" title="12">section 1817(a) of title 12</uscode>, <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="1467a" title="12">section 1467a(b) of title 12</uscode>, or <uscode edition="1999" section="1847" title="12">section 1847 of title 12</uscode>. The Secretary may, however, by rule adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A), require any registered government securities broker or government securities dealer filing such reports with the appropriate regulatory agency to obtain, maintain, or report supplemental information if the Secretary makes an explicit finding, based on information provided by the appropriate regulatory agency, that such supplemental information is necessary to inform the appropriate regulatory agency regarding potential risks to such government securities broker or government securities dealer. Prior to requiring any such supplemental information, the Secretary shall first request the Federal banking agency to expand its reporting requirements to include such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Procedure for requiring additional information</cap-smallcap>.—Prior to making a request pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for information with respect to an associated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the appropriate regulatory agency shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) notify such banking agency of the information required with respect to such associated person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) consult with such agency to determine whether the information required is <!-- PDFPage:255 -->available from such agency and for other purposes, unless the appropriate regulatory agency determines that any delay resulting from such consultation would be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition of the government securities broker or government securities dealer or the stability or integrity of the securities markets.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion for examination reports</cap-smallcap>.—Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit the Secretary or an appropriate regulatory agency to require any registered government securities broker or government securities dealer to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analysis contained therein.</p>

Nothing in this clause shall authorize the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory agency to withhold information from Congress, or prevent the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory agency from complying with a request for information from any other Federal department or agency requesting the information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) <cap-smallcap>Notice to banking agencies concerning financial and operational condition concerns</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary or appropriate regulatory agency shall notify the Federal banking agency of any concerns of the Secretary or the appropriate regulatory agency regarding significant financial or operational risks resulting from the activities of any government securities broker or government securities dealer to any associated person thereof which is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of the Federal banking agency.</p>

Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory agency to withhold information from Congress, or prevent the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory agency from complying with a request for information from any other Federal department or agency requesting the information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission. For purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode>, this paragraph shall be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such section 552.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the appropriate regulatory agency, that such rule or regulation, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the appropriate regulatory agency shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule or regulation, find that such rule or regulation is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary's determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The appropriate regulatory agency shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary prior to approving or amending a rule or regulation under this paragraph, except where the appropriate regulatory agency determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious and summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In promulgating rules under this section, the appropriate regulatory agency shall consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of then existing laws and rules applicable to government securities brokers, government securities dealers, and persons associated with government securities brokers and government securities dealers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Rules promulgated and orders issued under this section shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect the integrity, liquidity, and efficiency of the market for government securities, investors, and the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, government securities brokers, or government securities dealers, or to impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In promulgating rules and issuing orders under this section, the Secretary—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may appropriately classify government securities brokers and government securities dealers (taking into account relevant matters, including types of business done, nature of securities other than government securities purchased or sold, and character of business organization) and persons associated with government securities brokers and government securities dealers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may determine, to the extent consistent with paragraph (2) of this subsection and with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this chapter, not to apply, in whole or in part, certain rules under this section, or to apply greater, lesser, or different standards, to certain classes of government securities brokers, government securities dealers, or persons associated with government securities brokers or government securities dealers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of then existing laws and rules applicable to government securities brokers, government securities dealers, and persons associated with government securities brokers and government securities dealers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall consult with and consider the views of the Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, except where the Secretary determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons for such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the Commission or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Secretary that has been published for comment, the Secretary shall respond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No government securities broker or government securities dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any government security in contravention of any rule under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sanctions for violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any government securities broker or government securities dealer registered or required to register under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section—</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§78q–1. National system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; facilitating establishment of system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement impose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) New data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The linking of all clearance and settlement facilities and the development of uniform standards and procedures for clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and increase the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this chapter—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities (other than exempt securities); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of transactions in securities, securities options, contracts of sale for future delivery and options thereon, and commodity options;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:271 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall use its authority under this chapter to assure equal regulation under this chapter of registered clearing agencies and registered transfer agents. In carrying out its responsibilities set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, the Commission shall coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and consult with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration of clearing agencies; application; determinations by Commission requisite to registration of applicant as clearing agency; denial of participation; discipline; summary proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any clearing agency, unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security (other than an exempted security). The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any clearing agency or security or any class of clearing agencies or securities from any provisions of this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds. A clearing agency or transfer agent shall not perform the functions of both a clearing agency and a transfer agent unless such clearing agency or transfer agent is registered in accordance with this subsection and subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A clearing agency may be registered under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided in this subsection and in accordance with the provisions of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a) of this title</uscode>, by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the rules of the clearing agency and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A clearing agency shall not be registered unless the Commission determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Such clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible, to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible, to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder, to enforce (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="1999" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) compliance by its participants with the rules of the clearing agency, and to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, the rules of the clearing agency provide that any (i) registered broker or dealer, (ii) other registered clearing agency, (iii) registered investment company, (iv) bank, (v) insurance company, or (vi) other person or class of persons as the Commission, by rule, may from time to time designate as appropriate to the development of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions may become a participant in such clearing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The rules of the clearing agency assure a fair representation of its shareholders (or members) and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. (The Commission may determine that the representation of participants is fair if they are afforded a reasonable opportunity to acquire voting stock of the clearing agency, directly or indirectly, in reasonable proportion to their use of such clearing agency.)</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The rules of the clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The rules of the clearing agency do not impose any schedule of prices, or fix rates or other fees, for services rendered by its participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination in the admission of participants or among participants in the use of the clearing agency, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this section or the administration of the clearing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The rules of the clearing agency provide that (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)" edition="1999" range="78q(d) or 78s(g)(2)" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) or 78s(g)(2) of this title</uscode>) its participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of any provision of the rules of the clearing agency by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, or any other fitting sanction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The rules of the clearing agency are in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection, and, in general, provide a fair procedure with respect to the disciplining of participants, the denial of participation to any person seeking participation therein, and the prohibition or limitation by the clearing agency of any person with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The rules of the clearing agency do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A registered clearing agency may, and in cases in which the Commission, by order, di<!-- PDFPage:272 -->rects as appropriate in the public interest shall, deny participation to any person subject to a statutory disqualification. A registered clearing agency shall file notice with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting any person to participation, if the clearing agency knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that such person was subject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A registered clearing agency may deny participation to, or condition the participation of, any person if such person does not meet such standards of financial responsibility, operational capability, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the clearing agency. A registered clearing agency may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to be a participant in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the clearing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to determine whether a participant should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph), the clearing agency shall bring specific charges, notify such participant of, and give him an opportunity to defend against such charges, and keep a record. A determination by the clearing agency to impose a disciplinary sanction shall be supported by a statement setting forth—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any act or practice in which such participant has been found to have engaged, or which such participant has been found to have omitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the specific provisions of the rules of the clearing agency which any such act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to determine whether a person shall be denied participation or prohibited or limited with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency, the clearing agency shall notify such person of, and give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for denial or prohibition or limitation under consideration and keep a record. A determination by the clearing agency to deny participation or prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency shall be supported by a statement setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial or prohibition or limitation is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily suspend and close the accounts of a participant who (i) has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) is in default of any delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency, or (iii) is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency determines and so notifies the appropriate regulatory agency for such participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants, creditors, or investors. A participant so summarily suspended shall be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the clearing agency in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The appropriate regulatory agency for such participant, by order, may stay any such summary suspension on its own motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby, if such appropriate regulatory agency determines summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments) that such stay is consistent with the public interest and protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No registered clearing agency shall prohibit or limit access by any person to services offered by any participant therein.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any transfer agent, unless registered in accordance with this section, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the function of a transfer agent with respect to any security registered under section 78<em>l</em> of this title or which would be required to be registered except for the exemption from registration provided by subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of that section. The appropriate regulatory agency, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or security or class of persons or securities from any provision of this section or any rule or regulation prescribed under this section, if the appropriate regulatory agency finds (A) that such exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of this section, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds, and (B) the Commission does not object to such exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A transfer agent may be registered by filing with the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such transfer agent and any persons associated with the transfer agent as such appropriate regulatory agency may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Except as hereinafter provided, such registration shall become effective 45 days after receipt of such application by such appropriate regulatory agency or within such shorter period of time as such appropriate regulatory agency may determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The appropriate regulatory agency for a transfer agent, by order, shall deny registration to, censure, place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or revoke the registration of such transfer agent, if such appropriate regulatory agency finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such denial, censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest and that such transfer agent, whether prior or subsequent <!-- PDFPage:273 -->to becoming such, or any person associated with such transfer agent, whether prior or subsequent to becoming so associated—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has committed or omitted any act enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section 78<em>o</em>(b) of this title, has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) within ten years of the commencement of the proceedings under this paragraph, or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph (4); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is subject to an order entered pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of this subsection barring or suspending the right of such person to be associated with a transfer agent.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Pending final determination whether any registration by a transfer agent under this subsection shall be denied, the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent, by order, may postpone the effective date of such registration for a period not to exceed fifteen days, but if, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which may consist solely of affidavits and oral arguments), it shall appear to such appropriate regulatory agency to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to postpone the effective date of such registration until final determination, such appropriate regulatory agency shall so order. Pending final determination whether any registration under this subsection shall be revoked, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to such appropriate regulatory agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A registered transfer agent may, upon such terms and conditions as the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or in furtherance of the purposes of this section, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with such appropriate regulatory agency. If such appropriate regulatory agency finds that any transfer agent for which it is the appropriate regulatory agency, is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a transfer agent, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, shall cancel or deny the registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The appropriate regulatory agency for a transfer agent, by order, shall censure or place limitations on the activities or functions of any person associated, seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, associated or seeking to become associated with the transfer agent, or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or bar any such person from being associated with the transfer agent, if the appropriate regulatory agency finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person has committed or omitted any act enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (G) or <sup><a href="#78q-1_1_target" name="78q-1_1">1</a></sup> paragraph (4) of section 78<em>o</em>(b) of this title, has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) within ten years of the commencement of the proceedings under this paragraph, or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph (4). It shall be unlawful for any person as to whom such an order suspending or barring him from being associated with a transfer agent is in effect willfully to become, or to be, associated with a transfer agent without the consent of the appropriate regulatory agency that entered the order and the appropriate regulatory agency for that transfer agent. It shall be unlawful for any transfer agent to permit such a person to become, or remain, a person associated with it without the consent of such appropriate regulatory agencies, if the transfer agent knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such order. The Commission may establish, by rule, procedures by which a transfer agent reasonably can determine whether a person associated or seeking to become associated with it is subject to any such order, and may require, by rule, that any transfer agent comply with such procedures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Activities of clearing agencies and transfer agents; enforcement by appropriate regulatory agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No registered clearing agency or registered transfer agent shall, directly or indirectly, engage in any activity as clearing agency or transfer agent in contravention of such rules and regulations (A) as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, or (B) as the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or transfer agent may prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the safeguarding of securities and funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to any clearing agency or transfer agent for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or transfer agent may, in accordance with <uscode edition="1999" section="1818" title="12">section 1818 of title 12</uscode>, enforce compliance by such clearing agency or transfer agent with the provisions of this section, <uscode edition="1999" range="78q and 78s" section="78q" title="15">sections 78q and 78s of this title</uscode>, and the rules and regulations thereunder. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any violation of any such provision shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" range="1818(b) or 1818(c)" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(b) or 1818(c) of title 12</uscode>, and the participants in any such clearing agency and the persons doing business with any such transfer agent shall be deemed to be “depositors” as that term is used in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1999" section="1818" title="12">section 1818(c) of title 12</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) With respect to any clearing agency or transfer agent for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission and the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or transfer agent shall consult and cooperate with each other, and, as may be appropriate, with State banking authorities having supervision over such clearing agency or transfer agent toward the end that, to the maximum extent practicable, their respective regulatory responsibilities may be fulfilled and the <!-- PDFPage:274 -->rules and regulations applicable to such clearing agency or transfer agent may be in accord with both sound banking practices and a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. In accordance with this objective—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Commission and such appropriate regulatory agency shall, at least fifteen days prior to the issuance for public comment of any proposed rule or regulation or adoption of any rule or regulation concerning such clearing agency or transfer agent, consult and request the views of the other; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such appropriate regulatory agency shall assume primary responsibility to examine and enforce compliance by such clearing agency or transfer agent with the provisions of this section and <uscode edition="1999" range="78q and 78s" section="78q" title="15">sections 78q and 78s of this title</uscode>.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in the preceding subparagraph or elsewhere in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit (other than by the requirement of notification) the Commission's authority to make rules under any provision of this chapter or to enforce compliance pursuant to any provision of this chapter by any clearing agency, transfer agent, or person associated with a transfer agent with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the authority of any State banking authority or other State or Federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction over a person registered as a clearing agency, transfer agent, or person associated with a transfer agent, to make and enforce rules governing such person which are not inconsistent with this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A registered transfer agent may not, directly or indirectly, engage in any activity in connection with the guarantee of a signature of an endorser of a security, including the acceptance or rejection of such guarantee, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, to facilitate the equitable treatment of financial institutions which issue such guarantees, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Physical movement of securities certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall use its authority under this chapter to end the physical movement of securities certificates in connection with the settlement among brokers and dealers of transactions in securities consummated by means of the mails or any means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules concerning transfer of securities and rights and obligations of involved or affected parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, except as provided in paragraph (3), if the Commission makes each of the findings described in paragraph (2)(A), the Commission may adopt rules concerning—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the transfer of certificated or uncertificated securities (other than government securities issued pursuant to <uscode chapter="31" edition="1999" title="31">chapter 31 of title 31</uscode> or securities otherwise processed within a book-entry system operated by the Federal Reserve banks pursuant to a Federal book-entry regulation) or limited interests (including security interests) therein; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) rights and obligations of purchasers, sellers, owners, lenders, borrowers, and financial intermediaries (including brokers, dealers, banks, and clearing agencies) involved in or affected by such transfers, and the rights of third parties whose interests in such securities devolve from such transfers.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The findings described in this paragraph are findings by the Commission that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such rule is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or in the public interest and is reasonably designed to promote the prompt, accurate, and safe clearance and settlement of securities transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the absence of a uniform rule, the safe and efficient operation of the national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions will be, or is, substantially impeded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to the extent such rule will impair or diminish, directly or indirectly, rights of persons specified in paragraph (1)(B) under State law concerning transfers of securities (or limited interests therein), the benefits of such rule outweigh such impairment or diminution of rights.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In making the findings described in subparagraph (A), the Commission shall give consideration to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee established under paragraph (4), and it shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If the Secretary of the Treasury objects, in writing, to any proposed rule of the Commission on the basis of the Secretary's view on the issues described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A), the Commission shall consider all feasible alternatives to the proposed rule, and it shall not adopt any such rule unless the Commission makes an explicit finding that the rule is the most practicable method for achieving safe and efficient operation of the national clearance and settlement system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any State may, prior to the expiration of 2 years after the Commission adopts a rule under this subsection, enact a statute that specifically refers to this subsection and the specific rule thereunder and establishes, prospectively from the date of enactment of the State statute, a provision that differs from that applicable under the Commission's rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Within 90 days after October 16, 1990, the Commission shall (and at such times thereafter as the Commission may determine, the Commission may), after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, establish an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.). The Advisory Committee shall be directed to consider and report to the Commission on such matters as the Commission, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines, including the areas, if any, in which <!-- PDFPage:275 -->State commercial laws and related Federal laws concerning the transfer of certificated or uncertificated securities, limited interests (including security interests) in such securities, or the creation or perfection of security interests in such securities do not provide the necessary certainty, uniformity, and clarity for purchasers, sellers, owners, lenders, borrowers, and financial intermediaries concerning their respective rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Advisory Committee shall consist of 15 members, of which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 11 shall be designated by the Commission in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 2 each shall be designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Advisory Committee shall conduct its activities in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Within 6 months of its designation, or such longer time as the Commission may designate, the Advisory Committee shall issue a report to the Commission, and shall cause copies of that report to be delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the market for penny stocks suffers from a lack of reliable and accurate quotation and last sale information available to investors and regulators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to improve significantly the information available to brokers, dealers, investors, and regulators with respect to quotations for and transactions in penny stocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a fully implemented automated quotation system for penny stocks would meet the information needs of investors and market participants and would add visibility and regulatory and surveillance data to that market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Mandate to facilitate establishment of automated quotation systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall facilitate the widespread dissemination of reliable and accurate <!-- PDFPage:276 -->last sale and quotation information with respect to penny stocks in accordance with the findings set forth in subsection (a) of this section, with a view toward establishing, at the earliest feasible time, one or more automated quotation systems that will collect and disseminate information regarding all penny stocks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Characteristics of systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each such automated quotation system shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be operated by a registered securities association or a national securities exchange in accordance with such rules as the Commission and these entities shall prescribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) collect and disseminate quotation and transaction information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, provide bid and ask quotations of participating brokers or dealers, or comparably accurate and reliable pricing information, which shall constitute firm bids or offers for at least such minimum numbers of shares or minimum dollar amounts as the Commission and the registered securities association or national securities exchange shall require; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provide for the reporting of the volume of penny stock transactions, including last sale reporting, when the volume reaches appropriate levels that the Commission shall specify by rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptive authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, by rule or order, grant such exemptions, in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally, to any penny stock or class of penny stocks from the requirements of subsection (b) of this section as the Commission determines to be consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Commission reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in each of the first 5 annual reports (under <uscode detail="(b)(1)" edition="1999" section="78w" title="15">section 78w(b)(1) of this title</uscode>) submitted more than 12 months after October 15, 1990, include a description of the status of the penny stock automated quotation system or systems required by subsection (b) of this section. Such description shall include—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a review of the development, implementation, and progress of the project, including achievement of significant milestones and current project schedule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a review of the activities of registered securities associations and national securities exchanges in the development of the system.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration procedures; notice of filing; other regulatory agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for registration as a national securities exchange, registered securities association, or registered clearing agency, pursuant to section 78f, 78<em>o</em>–3, or 78q–1 of this title, respectively, publish notice of such filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such application. Within ninety days of the date of publication of such notice (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant such registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days of the date of a publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant such registration if it finds that the requirements of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the applicant are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to an application for registration filed by a clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Commission shall not grant registration prior to the sixtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of such application unless the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency has notified the Commission of such appropriate regulatory agency's determination that such clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible and that the rules of such clearing agency are designed to assure the safeguarding of such securities and funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Commission shall institute proceedings in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to determine whether registration should be denied if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission within sixty days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of such application of such appropriate regulatory agency's (i) determination that such clearing agency may not be so organized or have the capacity to be able to safeguard securities or funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible or that the rules of such clearing agency may not be designed to assure the safeguarding of such securities and funds and (ii) reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall deny registration if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission prior to the conclusion of proceedings instituted in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection of such appropriate regulatory agency's (i) determination that such clearing agency is not so organized or does not have the capacity to be able to safeguard securities or funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible or that the rules of such clearing agency are not designed to assure the safeguarding of such securities or funds and (ii) reasons for such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A self-regulatory organization may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission, by rule, deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any self-regulatory organization is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for registration, the Commission, by order, shall cancel its registration. Upon the withdrawal of a national securities association from registration or the cancellation, suspension, or revocation of the registration of a national securities association, the registration of any association affiliated therewith shall automatically terminate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proposed rule changes; notice; proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each self-regulatory organization shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules as the Commission may prescribe, copies of any proposed rule or any proposed change in, addition to, or deletion from the rules of such self-regulatory organization (hereinafter in this subsection collectively referred to as a “proposed rule change”) accompanied by a concise general statement of the basis and purpose of such proposed rule change. The Commission shall, upon the filing of any proposed rule change, publish notice thereof together with the terms of substance of the proposed rule change or a description of the subjects and issues involved. The Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such proposed rule change. No proposed rule change shall take effect unless approved by the Commission or otherwise permitted in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:278 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, or within such longer period as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order approve such proposed rule change, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration and opportunity for hearing and be concluded within one hundred eighty days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of the proposed rule change. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall approve or disapprove such proposed rule change. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to sixty days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the self-regulatory organization consents.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall approve a proposed rule change of a self-regulatory organization if it finds that such proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization. The Commission shall disapprove a proposed rule change of a self-regulatory organization if it does not make such finding. The Commission shall not approve any proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing thereof, unless the Commission finds good cause for so doing and publishes its reasons for so finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a proposed rule change may take effect upon filing with the Commission if designated by the self-regulatory organization as (i) constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the self-regulatory organization, (ii) establishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization, or (iii) concerned solely with the administration of the self-regulatory organization or other matters which the Commission, by rule, consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this subsection, may specify as without the provisions of such paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a proposed rule change may be put into effect summarily if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary for the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or the safeguarding of securities or funds. Any proposed rule change so put into effect shall be filed promptly thereafter in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any proposed rule change of a self-regulatory organization which has taken effect pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph may be enforced by such organization to the extent it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and applicable Federal and State law. At any time within sixty days of the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission summarily may abrogate the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization made thereby and require that the proposed rule change be refiled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. Commission action pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not affect the validity or force of the rule change during the period it was in effect and shall not be reviewable under <uscode edition="1999" section="78y" title="15">section 78y of this title</uscode> nor deemed to be “final agency action” for purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="704" title="5">section 704 of title 5</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) With respect to a proposed rule change filed by a registered clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Commission shall not approve any such proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing whereof unless the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency has notified the Commission of such appropriate regulatory agency's determination that the proposed rule change is consistent with the safeguarding of securities and funds in the custody or control of such clearing agency or for which it is responsible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Commission shall institute proceedings in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection to determine whether any such proposed rule change should be disapproved, if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission within thirty days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of the proposed rule change of such appropriate regulatory agency's (i) determination that the proposed rule change may be inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of such clearing agency or for which it is responsible and (ii) reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall disapprove any such proposed rule change if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission prior to the conclusion of proceedings instituted in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection of such appropriate regulatory agency's (i) determination that the proposed rule change is inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of such clearing agency or for which it is responsible and (ii) reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Commission shall abrogate any change in the rules of such a clearing agency made by a proposed rule change which has taken effect pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, require that the proposed rule <!-- PDFPage:279 -->change be refiled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission within thirty days of the date of filing of such proposed rule change of such appropriate regulatory agency's (i) determination that the rules of such clearing agency as so changed may be inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of such clearing agency or for which it is responsible and (ii) reasons for such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government securities, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary's determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In approving rules described in paragraph (5), the Commission shall consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of then existing laws and rules applicable to government securities brokers, government securities dealers, and persons associated with government securities brokers and government securities dealers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment by Commission of rules of self-regulatory organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rule, may abrogate, add to, and delete from (hereinafter in this subsection collectively referred to as “amend”) the rules of a self-regulatory organization (other than a registered clearing agency) as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to insure the fair administration of the self-regulatory organization, to conform its rules to requirements of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commission shall notify the self-regulatory organization and publish notice of the proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. The notice shall include the text of the proposed amendment to the rules of the self-regulatory organization and a statement of the Commission's reasons, including any pertinent facts, for commencing such proposed rulemaking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, and arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall incorporate the text of the amendment to the rules of the self-regulatory organization and a statement of the Commission's basis for and purpose in so amending such rules. This statement shall include an identification of any facts on which the Commission considers its determination so to amend the rules of the self-regulatory agency to be based, including the reasons for the Commission's conclusions as to any of such facts which were disputed in the rulemaking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection, rulemaking under this subsection shall be in accordance with the procedures specified in <uscode edition="1999" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode> for rulemaking not on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit the Commission's power to make, or to modify or alter the procedures the Commission may follow in making, rules and regulations pursuant to any other authority under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any amendment to the rules of a self-regulatory organization made by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be considered for all purposes of this chapter to be part of the rules of such self-regulatory organization and shall not be considered to be a rule of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) With respect to rules described in subsection (b)(5) of this section, the Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury before abrogating, adding to, and deleting from such rules, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice of disciplinary action taken by self-regulatory organization against a member or participant; review of action by appropriate regulatory agency; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any self-regulatory organization imposes any final disciplinary sanction on any member thereof or participant therein, denies membership or participation to any applicant, or prohibits or limits any person in respect to access to services offered by such organization or member thereof or if any self-regulatory organization (other than a registered clearing agency) imposes any final disciplinary sanction on any person associated with a member or bars any person from becoming associated with a member, the self-regulatory organization shall promptly file notice thereof with the appropriate regulatory agency for the self-regulatory organization and (if other than the appropriate regulatory agency for the self-regulatory organization) the appropriate regulatory agency for such member, participant, applicant, or other person. The notice shall be in such form and contain such information as the appropriate regulatory agency for the self-regulatory organiza<!-- PDFPage:280 -->tion, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any action with respect to which a self-regulatory organization is required by paragraph (1) of this subsection to file notice shall be subject to review by the appropriate regulatory agency for such member, participant, applicant, or other person, on its own motion, or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby filed within thirty days after the date such notice was filed with such appropriate regulatory agency and received by such aggrieved person, or within such longer period as such appropriate regulatory agency may determine. Application to such appropriate regulatory agency for review, or the institution of review by such appropriate regulatory agency on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of such action unless such appropriate regulatory agency otherwise orders, summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments). Each appropriate regulatory agency shall establish for appropriate cases an expedited procedure for consideration and determination of the question of a stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disposition of review; cancellation, reduction, or remission of sanction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any proceeding to review a final disciplinary sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization on a member thereof or participant therein or a person associated with such a member, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of consideration of the record before the self-regulatory organization and opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons to affirm, modify, or set aside the sanction)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the appropriate regulatory agency for such member, participant, or person associated with a member finds that such member, participant, or person associated with a member has engaged in such acts or practices, or has omitted such acts, as the self-regulatory organization has found him to have engaged in or omitted, that such acts or practices, or omissions to act, are in violation of such provisions of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, the rules of the self-regulatory organization, or, in the case of a registered securities association, the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as have been specified in the determination of the self-regulatory organization, and that such provisions are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of this chapter, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, shall so declare and, as appropriate, affirm the sanction imposed by the self-regulatory organization, modify the sanction in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, or remand to the self-regulatory organization for further proceedings; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such appropriate regulatory agency does not make any such finding it shall, by order, set aside the sanction imposed by the self-regulatory organization and, if appropriate, remand to the self-regulatory organization for further proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the appropriate regulatory agency for a member, participant, or person associated with a member, having due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, finds after a proceeding in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection that a sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization upon such member, participant, or person associated with a member imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter or is excessive or oppressive, the appropriate regulatory agency may cancel, reduce, or require the remission of such sanction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Dismissal of review proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding to review the denial of membership or participation in a self-regulatory organization to any applicant, the barring of any person from becoming associated with a member of a self-regulatory organization, or the prohibition or limitation by a self-regulatory organization of any person with respect to access to services offered by the self-regulatory organization or any member thereof, if the appropriate regulatory agency for such applicant or person, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of consideration of the record before the self-regulatory organization and opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons to dismiss the proceeding or set aside the action of the self-regulatory organization) finds that the specific grounds on which such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is based exist in fact, that such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is in accordance with the rules of the self-regulatory organization, and that such rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of this chapter, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If such appropriate regulatory agency does not make any such finding or if it finds that such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, shall set aside the action of the self-regulatory organization and require it to admit such applicant to membership or participation, permit such person to become associated with a member, or grant such person access to services offered by the self-regulatory organization or member thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Compliance with rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every self-regulatory organization shall comply with the provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and its own rules, and (subject to the provisions of <uscode detail="(d)" edition="1999" section="78q" title="15">section 78q(d) of this title</uscode>, paragraph (2) of this subsection, and the rules thereunder) absent reasonable justification or excuse enforce compliance—</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the other purposes of this chapter, may relieve any self-regulatory organization of any responsibility under this chapter to enforce compliance with any specified provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder by any member of such organization or person associated with such a member, or any class of such members or persons associated with a member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Suspension or revocation of self-regulatory organization's registration; censure; other sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The appropriate regulatory agency for a self-regulatory organization is authorized, by order, if in its opinion such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or revoke the registration of such self-regulatory organization, or to censure or impose limitations upon the activities, functions, and operations of such self-regulatory organization, if such appropriate regulatory agency finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such self-regulatory organization has violated or is unable to comply with any provision of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, or its own rules or without reasonable justification or excuse has failed to enforce compliance—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a national securities exchange, with any such provision by a member thereof or a person associated with a member thereof;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority and discretion of Commission to investigate violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission may, in its discretion, make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, the rules or regulations thereunder, the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member or a person associated with a member, the rules of a registered clearing agency in which such person is a participant, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and may require or permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Commission shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. The Commission is authorized in its discretion, to publish information concerning any such violations, and to investigate any facts, conditions, practices, or matters which it may deem necessary or proper to aid in the enforcement of such provisions, in the prescribing of rules and regulations under this chapter, or in securing information to serve as a basis for recommending further legislation concerning the matters to which this chapter relates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On request from a foreign securities authority, the Commission may provide assistance in accordance with this paragraph if the requesting authority states that the requesting authority is conducting an investigation which it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any laws or rules relating to securities matters that the requesting authority administers or enforces. The Commission may, in its discretion, conduct such investigation as the Commission deems necessary to collect information and evidence pertinent to the request for assistance. Such assistance may be provided without regard to whether the facts stated in the request would also constitute a violation of the laws of the United States. In deciding whether to provide such assistance, the Commission shall consider whether (A) the requesting authority has agreed to provide reciprocal assistance in securities matters to the Commission; and (B) compliance with the request would prejudice the public interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Attendance of witnesses; production of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of any such investigation, or any other proceeding under this chapter, any member of the Commission or any officer designated by it is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, or other records which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States or any State at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:285 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial enforcement of investigative power of Commission; refusal to obey subpena; criminal sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records. And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who shall, without just cause, fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records, if in his power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Injunction proceedings; authority of court to prohibit persons from serving as officers and directors; money penalties in civil actions</h4>

The Commission may transmit such evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices as may constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder to the Attorney General, who may, in his discretion, institute the necessary criminal proceedings under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Court To Prohibit Persons From Serving as Officers and Directors</cap-smallcap>.—In any proceeding under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or for such period of time as it shall determine, any person who violated <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="78j" title="15">section 78j(b) of this title</uscode> or the rules or regulations thereunder from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 78<em>l</em> of this title or that is required to file reports pursuant to section 78<em>o</em>(d) of this title if the person's conduct demonstrates substantial unfitness to serve as an officer or director of any such issuer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Remedy not exclusive</cap-smallcap>.—The actions authorized by this paragraph may be brought in addition to any other action that <!-- PDFPage:286 -->the Commission or the Attorney General is entitled to bring.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Jurisdiction and venue</cap-smallcap>.—For purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="78aa" title="15">section 78aa of this title</uscode>, actions under this paragraph shall be actions to enforce a liability or a duty created by this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Special provisions relating to a violation of a cease-and-desist order</cap-smallcap>.—In an action to enforce a cease-and-desist order entered by the Commission pursuant to section 78u–3 of this title, each separate violation of such order shall be a separate offense, except that in the case of a violation through a continuing failure to comply with the order, each day of the failure to comply shall be deemed a separate offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition of attorneys’ fees paid from commission disgorgement funds</cap-smallcap>.—Except as otherwise ordered by the court upon motion by the Commission, or, in the case of an administrative action, as otherwise ordered by the Commission, funds disgorged as the result of an action brought by the Commission in Federal court, or as a result of any Commission administrative action, shall not be distributed as payment for attorneys’ fees or expenses incurred by private parties seeking distribution of the disgorged funds.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules of self-regulatory organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall not bring any action pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) of this section against any person for violation of, or to command compliance with, the rules of a self-regulatory organization unless it appears to the Commission that (1) such self-regulatory organization is unable or unwilling to take appropriate action against such person in the public interest and for the protection of investors, or (2) such action is otherwise necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Extensions of the period of delay of notice provided in subparagraph (A) of up to ninety days each may be granted by the court upon application, but only in accordance with this subsection or section 1109(a), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="3409" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3409(a), </uscode>(b)(1), or (b)(2)].</p>

Section 1121(b) <sup><a href="#78u_1_target" name="78u_1">1</a></sup> of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 shall not apply with respect to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Following the expiration of the period of delay of notification ordered by the court pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, the customer may, upon motion, reopen the proceeding in the district court which issued the order. If the presiding judge or magistrate judge finds that the movant is the customer to whom the records obtained by the Commission pertain, and that the Commission has obtained financial records or information contained therein in violation of this subsection, other than paragraph (1), it may order that the customer be granted civil penalties against the Commission in an amount equal to the sum of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $100 without regard to the volume of records involved;</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon a finding that the Commission has obtained financial records or information contained therein in violation of this subsection, other than paragraph (1), the court, in its discretion, may also or in the alternative issue injunctive relief to require the Commission to comply with this subsection with respect to any subpena which the Commission issues in the future for financial records of such customer for purposes of the same investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever the court determines that the Commission has failed to comply with this subsection, other than paragraph (1), and the court finds that the circumstances raise questions of whether an officer or employee of the Commission acted in a willful and intentional manner and without good faith with respect to the violation, the Office of Personnel Management shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the agent or employee who was primarily responsible for the violation. After investigating and considering the evidence submitted, the Office of Personnel Management shall submit its findings and recommendations to the Commission and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The Commission shall take the corrective action that the Office of Personnel Management recommends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The relief described in paragraphs (7) and (10) shall be the only remedies or sanctions available to a customer for a violation of this subsection, other than paragraph (1), and nothing herein or in the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3401" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.</uscode>] shall be deemed to prohibit the use in any investigation or proceeding of financial records, or the information contained therein, obtained by a subpena issued by the Commission. In the case of an unsuccessful action under paragraph (7), the court shall award the costs of the action and attorney's fees to the Commission if the presiding judge or magistrate judge finds that the customer's claims were made in bad faith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9)(A) The Commission may transfer financial records or the information contained therein to any government authority if the Commission proceeds as a transferring agency in accordance with section 1112 of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3412" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3412</uscode>], except that the customer notice required under section 1112(b) or (c) of such Act [<uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="3412" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3412(b) </uscode>or (c)] may be delayed upon a showing by the Commission, in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5), that one or more of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (2) apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission may, without notice to the customer pursuant to section 1112 or the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3412" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3412</uscode>], transfer financial records or the informa<!-- PDFPage:288 -->tion contained therein to a State securities agency or to the Department of Justice. Financial records or information transferred by the Commission to the Department of Justice or to a State securities agency pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph may be disclosed or used only in an administrative, civil, or criminal action or investigation by the Department of Justice or the State securities agency which arises out of or relates to the acts, practices, or courses of conduct investigated by the Commission, except that if the Department of Justice or the State securities agency determines that the information should be disclosed or used for any other purpose, it may do so if it notifies the customer, except as otherwise provided in the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3401" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.</uscode>], within 30 days of its determination, or complies with the requirements of section 1109 of such Act [<uscode edition="1999" section="3409" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3409</uscode>] regarding delay of notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Any government authority violating paragraph (9) shall be subject to the procedures and penalties applicable to the Commission under paragraph (7)(A) with respect to a violation by the Commission in obtaining financial records.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the Commission may obtain financial records from a financial institution or transfer such records in accordance with provisions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3401" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) Nothing in this subsection shall enlarge or restrict any rights of a financial institution to challenge requests for records made by the Commission under existing law. Nothing in this subsection shall entitle a customer to assert any rights of a financial institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(13) Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms defined in the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [<uscode edition="1999" section="3401" title="12">12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.</uscode>] which are common to this subsection shall have the same meaning as in such Act.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to impose civil penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Judicial actions by Commission authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has violated any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder by purchasing or selling a security while in possession of material, nonpublic information in, or has violated any such provision by communicating such information in connection with, a transaction on or through the facilities of a national securities exchange or from or through a broker or dealer, and which is not part of a public offering by an issuer of securities other than standardized options, the Commission—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may bring an action in a United States district court to seek, and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, a civil penalty to be paid by the person who committed such violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may, subject to subsection (b)(1) of this section, bring an action in a United States district court to seek, and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, a civil penalty to be paid by a person who, at the time of the violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of penalty for person who committed violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the penalty which may be imposed on the person who committed such violation shall be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of such unlawful purchase, sale, or communication.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of penalty for controlling person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the penalty which may be imposed on any person who, at the time of the violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation, shall be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed the greater of $1,000,000, or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of such controlled person's violation. If such controlled person's violation was a violation by communication, the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the violation shall, for purposes of this paragraph only, be deemed to be limited to the profit gained or loss avoided by the person or persons to whom the controlled person directed such communication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability of controlling persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No controlling person shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section unless the Commission establishes that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such controlling person knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that such controlled person was likely to engage in the act or acts constituting the violation and failed to take appropriate steps to prevent such act or acts before they occurred; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such controlling person knowingly or recklessly failed to establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure required under section 78<em>o</em>(f) of this title or section 80b–4a of this title and such failure substantially contributed to or permitted the occurrence of the act or acts constituting the violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional restrictions on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a) of this section solely by reason of employing another person who is subject to a penalty under such subsection, unless such employing person is liable as a controlling person under paragraph (1) of this subsection. <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="78t" title="15">Section 78t(a) of this title</uscode> shall not apply to actions under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by such rules, regulations, and orders as it considers necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may exempt, in whole or in part, either unconditionally or upon specific terms and conditions, any person or transaction or class of persons or transactions from this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedures for collection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Payment of penalty to Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A penalty imposed under this section shall (subject to subsection (e) of this section) be payable into the Treasury of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collection of penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person upon whom such a penalty is imposed shall fail to pay such penalty within the time prescribed in the court's order, the Commission may refer the matter to the Attorney General who shall recover such penalty by action in the appropriate United States district court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedy not exclusive</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The actions authorized by this section may be brought in addition to any other actions <!-- PDFPage:291 -->that the Commission or the Attorney General are entitled to bring.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Jurisdiction and venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="78aa" title="15">section 78aa of this title</uscode>, actions under this section shall be actions to enforce a liability or a duty created by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Statute of limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No action may be brought under this section more than 5 years after the date of the purchase or sale. This section shall not be construed to bar or limit in any manner any action by the Commission or the Attorney General under any other provision of this chapter, nor shall it bar or limit in any manner any action to recover penalties, or to seek any other order regarding penalties, imposed in an action commenced within 5 years of such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to award bounties to informants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d)(1) of this section, there shall be paid from amounts imposed as a penalty under this section and recovered by the Commission or the Attorney General, such sums, not to exceed 10 percent of such amounts, as the Commission deems appropriate, to the person or persons who provide information leading to the imposition of such penalty. Any determinations under this subsection, including whether, to whom, or in what amount to make payments, shall be in the sole discretion of the Commission, except that no such payment shall be made to any member, officer, or employee of any appropriate regulatory agency, the Department of Justice, or a self-regulatory organization. Any such determination shall be final and not subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, “profit gained” or “loss avoided” is the difference between the purchase or sale price of the security and the value of that security as measured by the trading price of the security a reasonable period after public dissemination of the nonpublic information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has willfully violated any provision of the Securities Act of 1933 [<uscode edition="1999" section="77a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.</uscode>], the Investment Company Act of 1940 [<uscode edition="1999" section="80a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 80a</uscode>–1 et seq.], the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [<uscode edition="1999" section="80b" title="15">15 U.S.C. 80b</uscode>–1 et seq.], or this chapter, or the rules or regulations thereunder, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured such a violation by any other person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) has willfully made or caused to be made in any application for registration or report required to be filed with the Commission or with any other appropriate regulatory agency under this chapter, or in any proceeding before the Commission with respect to registration, any statement which was, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any such application or report any material fact which is required to be stated therein; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) has failed reasonably to supervise, within the meaning of section 78<em>o</em>(b)(4)(E) of this title, with a view to preventing violations of the provisions of such statutes, rules and regu<!-- PDFPage:292 -->lations, another person who commits such a violation, if such other person is subject to his supervision;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Second tier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the maximum amount of penalty for each such act or omission shall be $50,000 for a natural person or $250,000 for any other person if the act or omission described in subsection (a) of this section involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Third tier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the maximum amount of penalty for each such act or omission shall be $100,000 for a natural person or $500,000 for any other person if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the act or omission described in subsection (a) of this section involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such act or omission directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons or resulted in substantial pecuniary gain to the person who committed the act or omission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of public interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering under this section whether a penalty is in the public interest, the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may consider—</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evidence concerning ability to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in which the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may impose a penalty under this section, a respondent may present evidence of the respondent's ability to pay such penalty. The Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may, in its discretion, consider such evidence in determining whether such penalty is in the public interest. Such evidence may relate to the extent of such person's ability to continue in business and the collectability of a penalty, taking into account any other claims of the United States or third parties upon such person's assets and the amount of such person's assets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to enter order requiring accounting and disgorgement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in which the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may impose a penalty under this section, the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may enter an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, including reasonable interest.

<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or regulation <!-- PDFPage:293 -->thereunder, the Commission may publish its findings and enter an order requiring such person, and any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision, rule, or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Commission may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Commission deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Commission may specify, with such provision, rule, or regulation with respect to any security, any issuer, or any other person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice instituting proceedings pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after service of the notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Commission with the consent of any respondent so served.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary order</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Commission determines that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Commission may enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the violation or threatened violation and to take such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest as the Commission deems appropriate pending completion of such proceedings. Such an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Commission determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply only to a respondent that acts, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct acted, as a broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, or transfer agent, or is, or was at the time of the alleged misconduct, an associated person of, or a person seeking to become associated with, any of the foregoing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of temporary orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time after the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the respondent may apply to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended. If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing, the respondent may, within 10 days after the date on which the order was served, request a hearing on such application and the Commission shall hold a hearing and render a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judicial review</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Private class actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall apply in each private action arising under this chapter that is brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification filed with complaint</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each plaintiff seeking to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class shall provide a sworn certification, which shall be personally signed by such plaintiff and filed with the complaint, that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) states that the plaintiff has reviewed the complaint and authorized its filing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) states that the plaintiff did not purchase the security that is the subject of the complaint at the direction of plaintiff's counsel or in order to participate in any private action arising under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) states that the plaintiff is willing to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class, including providing testimony at deposition and trial, if necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) sets forth all of the transactions of the plaintiff in the security that is the subject of the complaint during the class period specified in the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) identifies any other action under this chapter, filed during the 3-year period preceding the date on which the certification is signed by the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff has sought to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) states that the plaintiff will not accept any payment for serving as a representative party on behalf of a class beyond the plaintiff's pro rata share of any recovery, except as ordered or approved by the court in accordance with paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonwaiver of attorney-client privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certification filed pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to be a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appointment of lead plaintiff</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Early notice to class members</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 20 days after the date on which the complaint is filed, the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall cause to be published, in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service, a notice advising members of the purported plaintiff class—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) of the pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein, and the purported class period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that, not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Multiple actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter is filed, only the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first filed action shall be required to cause notice to be published in accordance with clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Additional notices may be required under Federal rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notice required under clause (i) shall be in addition to any notice required pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appointment of lead plaintiff</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 90 days after the date on which a notice is published under subparagraph (A)(i), the court shall consider any motion made by a purported class member in response to the notice, including any motion by a class member who is not individually named as a plaintiff in the complaint or complaints, and shall appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the “most adequate plaintiff”) in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Consolidated actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter has been filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court shall not make the determination required by clause (i) until after the decision on the motion to consolidate is rendered. As soon as practicable after such decision is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rebuttable presumption</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (II), for purposes of clause (i), the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any private action arising under this chapter is the person or group of persons that—</p>
<!-- PDFPage:295 --><p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice under subparagraph (A)(i);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Rebuttal evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The presumption described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, discovery relating to whether a member or members of the purported plaintiff class is the most adequate plaintiff may be conducted by a plaintiff only if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis for a finding that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Selection of lead counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Restrictions on professional plaintiffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as the court may otherwise permit, consistent with the purposes of this section, a person may be a lead plaintiff, or an officer, director, or fiduciary of a lead plaintiff, in no more than 5 securities class actions brought as plaintiff class actions pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure during any 3-year period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recovery by plaintiffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal, on a per share basis, to the portion of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the class. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the representation of the class to any representative party serving on behalf of a class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restrictions on settlements under seal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class action shall not be filed under seal, except that on motion of any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which good cause is shown for such filing under seal. For purposes of this paragraph, good cause shall exist only if publication of a term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct and substantial harm to any party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Restrictions on payment of attorneys’ fees and expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Total attorneys’ fees and expenses awarded by the court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Disclosure of settlement terms to class members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any proposed or final settlement agreement that is published or otherwise disseminated to the class shall include each of the following statements, along with a cover page summarizing the information contained in such statements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Statement of plaintiff recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the settlement proposed to be distributed to the parties to the action, determined in the aggregate and on an average per share basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Statement of potential outcome of case</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Agreement on amount of damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the settling parties agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this chapter, a statement concerning the average amount of such potential damages per share.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Disagreement on amount of damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the parties do not agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this chapter, a statement from each settling party concerning the issue or issues on which the parties disagree.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Inadmissibility for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A statement made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) concerning the amount of damages shall not be admissible in any Federal or State judicial action or administrative proceeding, other than an action or proceeding arising out of such statement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Statement of attorneys’ fees or costs sought</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any of the settling parties or their counsel intend to apply to the court for an award of attorneys’ fees or costs from any fund established as part of the settlement, a statement indicating which parties or counsel intend to make such an application, the amount of fees and costs that will be sought (including the amount of such fees and costs determined on an average per share basis), and a brief explanation supporting the fees and costs sought. Such information shall be clearly summarized on the cover page of any notice to a party of any proposed or final settlement agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Identification of lawyers’ representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The name, telephone number, and address of one or more representatives of counsel for the plaintiff class who will be reasonably available to answer questions from class <!-- PDFPage:296 -->members concerning any matter contained in any notice of settlement published or otherwise disseminated to the class.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reasons for settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A brief statement explaining the reasons why the parties are proposing the settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Other information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such other information as may be required by the court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Security for payment of costs in class actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this chapter that is certified as a class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may require an undertaking from the attorneys for the plaintiff class, the plaintiff class, or both, or from the attorneys for the defendant, the defendant, or both, in such proportions and at such times as the court determines are just and equitable, for the payment of fees and expenses that may be awarded under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Attorney conflict of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plaintiff class is represented by an attorney who directly owns or otherwise has a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject of the litigation, the court shall make a determination of whether such ownership or other interest constitutes a conflict of interest sufficient to disqualify the attorney from representing the plaintiff class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements for securities fraud actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Misleading statements and omissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any private action arising under this chapter, the court shall, on the motion of any defendant, dismiss the complaint if the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) are not met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any private action arising under this chapter, all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss, unless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Preservation of evidence</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the pendency of any stay of discovery pursuant to this paragraph, unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party to the action with actual notice of the allegations contained in the complaint shall treat all documents, data compilations (including electronically recorded or stored data), and tangible objects that are in the custody or control of such person and that are relevant to the allegations, as if they were the subject of a continuing request for production of documents from an opposing party under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Sanction for willful violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A party aggrieved by the willful failure of an opposing party to comply with clause (i) may apply to the court for an order awarding appropriate sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Circumvention of stay of discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon a proper showing, a court may stay discovery proceedings in any private action in a State court, as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments, in an action subject to a stay of discovery pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Loss causation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate this chapter caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sanctions for abusive litigation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Mandatory review by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this chapter, upon final adjudication of the action, the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court makes a finding under paragraph (1) that a party or attorney violated any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion, the court shall impose sanctions on such party or attorney in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), for purposes of paragraph (2), the court shall adopt a presumption that the appropriate sanction—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for failure of any responsive pleading or dispositive motion to comply with any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for substantial failure of any complaint to comply with any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred in the action.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rebuttal evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The presumption described in subparagraph (A) may be rebutted only upon proof by the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the award of attorneys’ fees and other expenses will impose an unreasonable burden on that party or attorney and would be unjust, and the failure to make such an award would not impose a greater burden on the party in whose favor sanctions are to be imposed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the violation of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was de minimis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed meets its burden under subparagraph (B), the court shall award the sanctions that the court deems appropriate pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defendant's right to written interrogatories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages, the court shall, when requested by a defendant, submit to the jury a written interrogatory on the issue of each such defendant's state of mind at the time the alleged violation occurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, the award of damages to the plaintiff shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or received, as appropriate, by the plaintiff for the subject security and the mean trading price of that security during the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the information correcting the misstatement or omission that is the basis for the action is disseminated to the market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, if the plaintiff sells or repurchases the subject security prior to the expiration of the 90-day period described in paragraph (1), the plaintiff's damages shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or received, as appropriate, by the plaintiff for the security and the mean trading price of the security during the period beginning immediately after dissemination of information correcting the misstatement or omission and ending on the date on which the plaintiff sells or repurchases the security.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) “Mean trading price” defined</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Proportionate liability</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (A), a covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person, as determined under paragraph (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which a contractual relationship permits, a covered person that prevails in any private action may recover the attorney's fees and costs of that covered person in connection with the action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of responsibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any private action, the court shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories, or if there is no jury, shall make findings, with respect to each covered person and each of the other persons claimed by any of the parties to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff, includ<!-- PDFPage:298 -->ing persons who have entered into settlements with the plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether such person violated the securities laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the percentage of responsibility of such person, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) whether such person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of special interrogatories or findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responses to interrogatories, or findings, as appropriate, under subparagraph (A) shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility of each covered person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the percentage of responsibility under this paragraph, the trier of fact shall consider—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the nature of the conduct of each covered person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the nature and extent of the causal relationship between the conduct of each such person and the damages incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Uncollectible share</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B), upon <sup><a href="#78u-4_1_target" name="78u-4_1">1</a></sup> motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is entered in any private action, the court determines that all or part of the share of the judgment of the covered person is not collectible against that covered person, and is also not collectible against a covered person described in paragraph (2)(A), each covered person described in paragraph (2)(B) shall be liable for the uncollectible share as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Percentage of net worth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each covered person shall be jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if the plaintiff establishes that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the net worth of the plaintiff is equal to less than $200,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) immaterial; or</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the plaintiff fails to prove that the forward-looking statement—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In any private action arising under this chapter, the court shall stay discovery (other than discovery that is specifically directed to the applicability of the exemption provided for in this section) during the pendency of any motion by a defendant for summary judgment that is based on the grounds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the statement or omission upon which the complaint is based is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exemption provided for in this section precludes a claim for relief.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) “Records” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode> the term “records” includes all applications, statements, reports, contracts, correspondence, notices, and other documents filed with or otherwise obtained by the Commission pursuant to this chapter or otherwise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any member, officer, or employee of the Commission to disclose to any person other than a member, officer, or employee of the Commission, or to use for personal benefit, any information contained in any application, statement, report, contract, correspondence, notice, or other document filed with or otherwise obtained by the Commission (1) in contravention of the rules and regulations of the Commission under <uscode edition="1999" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode>, or (2) in circumstances where the Commission has deter<!-- PDFPage:305 -->mined pursuant to such rules to accord confidential treatment to such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Confidential disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, in its discretion and upon a showing that such information is needed, provide all “records” (as defined in subsection (a) of this section) and other information in its possession to such persons, both domestic and foreign, as the Commission by rule deems appropriate if the person receiving such records or information provides such assurances of confidentiality as the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Records obtained from foreign securities authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose records obtained from a foreign securities authority if (1) the foreign securities authority has in good faith determined and represented to the Commission that public disclosure of such records would violate the laws applicable to that foreign securities authority, and (2) the Commission obtains such records pursuant to (A) such procedure as the Commission may authorize for use in connection with the administration or enforcement of the securities laws, or (B) a memorandum of understanding. For purposes of <uscode edition="1999" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode>, this subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such section 552.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§78y. Court review of orders and rules</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Final Commission orders; persons aggrieved; petition; record; findings; affirmance, modification, enforcement, or setting aside of orders; remand to adduce additional evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person aggrieved by a final order of the Commission entered pursuant to this chapter may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of the order, a written petition requesting that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the court to a member <!-- PDFPage:306 -->of the Commission or an officer designated by the Commission for that purpose. Thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record on which the order complained of is entered, as provided in <uscode edition="1999" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode> and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the record, to affirm or modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there was reasonable ground for failure to adduce it before the Commission, the court may remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings, in whatever manner and on whatever conditions the court considers appropriate. If the case is remanded to the Commission, it shall file in the court a supplemental record containing any new evidence, any further or modified findings, and any new order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commission rules; persons adversely affected; petition; record; affirmance, enforcement, or setting aside of rules; findings; transfer of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person adversely affected by a rule of the Commission promulgated pursuant to section 78f, 78i(h)(2), 78k, 78k–1, 78<em>o</em>(c)(5) or (6), 78<em>o</em>–3, 78q, 78q–1, or 78s of this title may obtain review of this rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business or for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the promulgation of the rule, a written petition requesting that the rule be set aside.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer designated for that purpose. Thereupon, the Commission shall file in the court the rule under review and any documents referred to therein, the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking and any documents referred to therein, all written submissions and the transcript of any oral presentations in the rulemaking, factual information not included in the foregoing that was considered by the Commission in the promulgation of the rule or proffered by the Commission as pertinent to the rule, the report of any advisory committee received or considered by the Commission in the rulemaking, and any other materials prescribed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the materials set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection, to affirm and enforce or to set aside the rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts identified by the Commission as the basis, in whole or in part, of the rule, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. The court shall affirm and enforce the rule unless the Commission's action in promulgating the rule is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; or without observance of procedure required by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If proceedings have been instituted under this subsection in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same rule, the Commission shall file the materials set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection in that court in which a proceeding was first instituted. The other courts shall thereupon transfer all such proceedings to the court in which the materials have been filed. For the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice that court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Objections not urged before Commission; stay of orders and rules; transfer of enforcement or review proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No objection to an order or rule of the Commission, for which review is sought under this section, may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The filing of a petition under this section does not operate as a stay of the Commission's order or rule. Until the court's jurisdiction becomes exclusive, the Commission may stay its order or rule pending judicial review if it finds that justice so requires. After the filing of a petition under this section, the court, on whatever conditions may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, may issue all necessary and appropriate process to stay the order or rule or to preserve status or rights pending its review; but (notwithstanding <uscode edition="1999" section="705" title="5">section 705 of title 5</uscode>) no such process may be issued by the court before the filing of the record or the materials set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section unless: (A) the Commission has denied a stay or failed to grant requested relief, (B) a reasonable period has expired since the filing of an application for a stay without a decision by the Commission, or (C) there was reasonable ground for failure to apply to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the same order or rule is the subject of one or more petitions for review filed under this section and an action for enforcement filed in a district court of the United States under section 78u(d) or (e) of this title, that court in which the petition or the action is first filed has jurisdiction with respect to the order or rule to the exclusion of any other court, and thereupon all such proceedings shall be transferred to that court; but, for the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice, that court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals or district court of the United States, whether or not a petition for review or an action for enforcement was originally filed in the transferee court. The scope of review by a district court under section 78u(d) or (e) of this title is in all cases the same as by a court of appeals under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other appropriate regulatory agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of the preceding subsections of this section, the term “Commission” includes <!-- PDFPage:307 -->the agencies enumerated in <uscode detail="(a)(34)" edition="1999" section="78c" title="15">section 78c(a)(34) of this title</uscode> insofar as such agencies are acting pursuant to this chapter and the Secretary of the Treasury insofar as he is acting pursuant to section 78<em>o</em>–5 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(4) of this section and <uscode edition="1999" section="706" title="5">section 706 of title 5</uscode>, an order of the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a) of this title</uscode> denying registration to a clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency or pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(b) of this title</uscode> disapproving a proposed rule change by such a clearing agency shall be deemed to be an order of the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency insofar as such order was entered by reason of a determination by such appropriate regulatory agency pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)(2)(C)" edition="1999" range="78s(a)(2)(C) or 78s(b)(4)(C)" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(a)(2)(C) or 78s(b)(4)(C) of this title</uscode> that such registration or proposed rule change would be inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Addition of rights and remedies; recovery of actual damages; State securities commissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the rights and remedies provided by this <!-- PDFPage:309 -->chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity; but no person permitted to maintain a suit for damages under the provisions of this chapter shall recover, through satisfaction of judgment in one or more actions, a total amount in excess of his actual damages on account of the act complained of. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or officer performing like functions) of any State over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder. No State law which prohibits or regulates the making or promoting of wagering or gaming contracts, or the operation of “bucket shops” or other similar or related activities, shall invalidate any put, call, straddle, option, privilege, or other security, or apply to any activity which is incidental or related to the offer, purchase, sale, exercise, settlement, or closeout of any such instrument, if such instrument is traded pursuant to rules and regulations of a self-regulatory organization that are filed with the Commission pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(b) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of disciplinary procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify existing law with regard to the binding effect (1) on any member of or participant in any self-regulatory organization of any action taken by the authorities of such organization to settle disputes between its members or participants, (2) on any municipal securities dealer or municipal securities broker of any action taken pursuant to a procedure established by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board to settle disputes between municipal securities dealers and municipal securities brokers, or (3) of any action described in paragraph (1) or (2) on any person who has agreed to be bound thereby.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Continuing validity of disciplinary sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The stay, setting aside, or modification pursuant to <uscode detail="(e)" edition="1999" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(e) of this title</uscode> of any disciplinary sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization on a member thereof, person associated with a member, or participant therein, shall not affect the validity or force of any action taken as a result of such sanction by the self-regulatory organization prior to such stay, setting aside, or modification: <em>Provided</em>, That such action is not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder. The rights of any person acting in good faith which arise out of any such action shall not be affected in any way by such stay, setting aside, or modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Physical location of facilities of registered clearing agencies or registered transfer agents not to subject changes in beneficial or record ownership of securities to State or local taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any tax on any change in beneficial or record ownership of securities effected through the facilities of a registered clearing agency or registered transfer agent or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor or upon the delivery or transfer of securities to or through or receipt from such agency or agent or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such change in beneficial or record ownership or such transfer or delivery or receipt would otherwise be taxable by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the taxing State or political subdivision. No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any tax on securities which are deposited in or retained by a registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such securities would otherwise be taxable by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the taxing State or political subdivision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exchange, broker, and dealer commissions; brokerage and research services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person using the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, in the exercise of investment discretion with respect to an account shall be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached a fiduciary duty under State or Federal law unless expressly provided to the contrary by a law enacted by the Congress or any State subsequent to June 4, 1975, solely by reason of his having caused the account to pay a member of an exchange, broker, or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker, or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if such person determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such member, broker, or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or his overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as to which he exercises investment discretion. This subsection is exclusive and plenary insofar as conduct is covered by the foregoing, unless otherwise expressly provided by contract: <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commission under any other provision of this chapter or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person exercising investment discretion with respect to an account shall make such disclosure of his policies and practices with respect to commissions that will be paid for effecting securities transactions, at such times and in such manner, as the appropriate regulatory agency, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection a person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) furnishes advice, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) effects securities transactions and performs functions incidental thereto (such as clearance, settlement, and custody) or required in connection therewith by rules of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization of which such person is a member or person associated with a member or in which such person is a participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitations on remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Class action limitations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) is made by or on behalf of the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer to holders of equity securities of the issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) concerns decisions of such equity holders with respect to voting their securities, acting in response to a tender or exchange offer, or exercising dissenters’ or appraisal rights.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State actions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, nothing in this subsection may be construed to preclude a State or political subdivision thereof or a State pension plan from bringing an action involving a covered security on its own behalf, or as a member of a class comprised solely of other States, political subdivisions, or State pension plans that are named plaintiffs, and that have authorized participation, in such action.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) State pension plan defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “State pension plan” means a pension plan established and maintained for its employees by the government of a State or political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Actions under contractual agreements between issuers and indenture trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), a covered class action that seeks to enforce a contractual agreement between an issuer and an indenture trustee may be maintained in a State or Federal court by a party to the agreement or a successor to such party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Remand of removed actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In an action that has been removed from a State court pursuant to paragraph (2), if the Federal court determines that the action may be maintained in State court pursuant to this subsection, the Federal court shall remand such action to such State court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Preservation of State jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State shall retain jurisdiction under the laws of such State to investigate and bring enforcement actions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Affirmative defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an affirmative defense to actions under subsection (a) or (i) of this section that—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of any civil investigation which, in the opinion of the Attorney General, is necessary and proper to enforce this section, the Attorney General or his designee are empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, take evidence, and require the pro<!-- PDFPage:318 -->duction of any books, papers, or other documents which the Attorney General deems relevant or material to such investigation. The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may be required from any place in the United States, or any territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States, at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, or other documents. Any such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Attorney General or his designee, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district in which such person resides or may be found. The Attorney General may make such rules relating to civil investigations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Guidelines by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 6 months after August 23, 1988, the Attorney General, after consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury, and after obtaining the views of all interested persons through public notice and comment procedures, shall determine to what extent compliance with this section would be enhanced and the business community would be assisted by further clarification of the preceding provisions of this section and may, based on such determination and to the extent necessary and appropriate, issue—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) guidelines describing specific types of conduct, associated with common types of export sales arrangements and business contracts, which for purposes of the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy, the Attorney General determines would be in conformance with the preceding provisions of this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Attorney General shall issue the guidelines and procedures referred to in the preceding sentence in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of <uscode chapter="5" edition="1999" title="5">chapter 5 of title 5</uscode> and those guidelines and procedures shall be subject to the provisions of <uscode chapter="7" edition="1999" title="15">chapter 7</uscode> of that title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Opinions of Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate departments and agencies of the United States and after obtaining the views of all interested persons through public notice and comment procedures, shall establish a procedure to provide responses to specific inquiries by domestic concerns concerning conformance of their conduct with the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this section. The Attorney General shall, within 30 days after receiving such a request, issue an opinion in response to that request. The opinion shall state whether or not certain specified prospective conduct would, for purposes of the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy, violate the preceding provisions of this section. Additional requests for opinions may be filed with the Attorney General regarding other specified prospective conduct that is beyond the scope of conduct specified in previous requests. In any action brought under the applicable provisions of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that conduct, which is specified in a request by a domestic concern and for which the Attorney General has issued an opinion that such conduct is in conformity with the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy, is in compliance with the preceding provisions of this section. Such a presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. In considering the presumption for purposes of this paragraph, a court shall weigh all relevant factors, including but not limited to whether the information submitted to the Attorney General was accurate and complete and whether it was within the scope of the conduct specified in any request received by the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall establish the procedure required by this paragraph in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of <uscode chapter="5" edition="1999" title="5">chapter 5 of title 5</uscode> and that procedure shall be subject to the provisions of <uscode chapter="7" edition="1999" title="15">chapter 7</uscode> of that title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any document or other material which is provided to, received by, or prepared in the Department of Justice or any other department or agency of the United States in connection with a request by a domestic concern under the procedure established under paragraph (1), shall be exempt from disclosure under <uscode edition="1999" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode> and shall not, except with the consent of the domestic concern, be made publicly available, regardless of whether the Attorney General responds to such a request or the domestic concern withdraws such request before receiving a response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any domestic concern who has made a request to the Attorney General under paragraph (1) may withdraw such request prior to the time the Attorney General issues an opinion in response to such request. Any request so withdrawn shall have no force or effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide timely guidance concerning the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy with respect to the preceding provisions of this section to potential exporters and small businesses that are unable to obtain specialized counsel on issues pertaining to such provisions. Such guidance shall be limited to responses to requests under paragraph (1) concerning conformity of specified prospective conduct with the Department of Justice's present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this section and general <!-- PDFPage:319 -->explanations of compliance responsibilities and of potential liabilities under the preceding provisions of this section.</p>
