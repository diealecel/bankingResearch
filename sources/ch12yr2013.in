<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to provide thrift institutions for the deposit of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and other goods and services, the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized, under such regulations as the Comptroller of the Currency may prescribe—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of associations to be known as Federal savings associations (including Federal savings banks), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to issue charters therefor,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">giving primary consideration of the best practices of thrift institutions in the United States. <!-- PDFPage:350 -->The lending and investment powers conferred by this section are intended to encourage such institutions to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposits and related powers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deposit accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to the terms of its charter and regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Federal savings association may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) raise funds through such deposit, share, or other accounts, including demand deposit accounts (hereafter in this section referred to as "accounts"); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) issue passbooks, certificates, or other evidence of accounts.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A Federal savings association may not permit any overdraft (including an intraday overdraft) on behalf of an affiliate, or incur any such overdraft in such savings association's account at a Federal reserve bank or Federal home loan bank on behalf of an affiliate.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">All savings accounts and demand accounts shall have the same priority upon liquidation. Holders of accounts and obligors of a Federal savings association shall, to such extent as may be provided by its charter or by regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, be members of the savings association, and shall have such voting rights and such other rights as are thereby provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A Federal savings association may require not less than 14 days notice prior to payment of savings accounts if the charter of the savings association or the regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency so provide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If a Federal savings association does not pay all withdrawals in full (subject to the right of the association, where applicable, to require notice), the payment of withdrawals from accounts shall be subject to such rules and procedures as may be prescribed by the savings association's charter or by regulation of the Comptroller of the Currency. Except as authorized in writing by the Comptroller of the Currency, any Federal savings association that fails to make full payment of any withdrawal when due shall be deemed to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Accounts may be subject to check or to withdrawal or transfer on negotiable or transferable or other order or authorization to the Federal savings association, as the Comptroller of the Currency may by regulation provide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A Federal savings association may establish remote service units for the purpose of crediting savings or demand accounts, debiting such accounts, crediting payments on loans, and the disposition of related financial transactions, as provided in regulations prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To such extent as the Comptroller of the Currency may authorize in writing, a Federal savings association may borrow, may give security, may be surety as defined by the Comptroller of the Currency and may issue such notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations, or other securities, including capital stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Loans from State housing finance agencies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency but without regard to any other provision of this subsection, any Federal savings association that is in compliance with the capital standards in effect under subsection (t) of this section may borrow funds from a State mortgage finance agency of the State in which the head office of such savings association is situated to the same extent as State law authorizes a savings association organized under the laws of such State to borrow from the State mortgage finance agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Federal savings association may not make any loan of funds borrowed under subparagraph (A) at an interest rate which exceeds by more than 1¾ percent per annum the interest rate paid to the State mortgage finance agency on the obligations issued to obtain the funds so borrowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Mutual capital certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations issued by the Comptroller of the Currency, mutual capital certificates may be issued and sold directly to subscribers or through underwriters. Such certificates may be included in calculating capital for the purpose of subsection (t) of this section to the extent permitted by the Comptroller of the Currency. The issuance of certificates under this paragraph does not constitute a change of control or ownership under this chapter or any other law unless there is in fact a change in control or reorganization. Regulations relating to the issuance and sale of mutual capital certificates shall provide that such certificates—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are subordinate to all savings accounts, savings certificates, and debt obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) constitute a claim in liquidation on the general reserves, surplus, and undivided profits of the Federal savings association remaining after the payment in full of all savings accounts, savings certificates, and debt obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are entitled to the payment of dividends; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) may have a fixed or variable dividend rate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loans and investments</h4>
