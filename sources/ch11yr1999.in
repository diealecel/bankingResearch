<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Number; appointment and election; qualifications; conflicts of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The management of each Federal home loan bank shall be vested in a board of fourteen directors, eight of whom shall be elected by the members as hereinafter provided in this section and six of whom shall be appointed by the Board referred to in <uscode edition="1999" section="1422a" title="12">section 1422a of this title</uscode>, all of whom shall be citizens of the United States, and each of whom shall be either a bona fide resident of the district in which such bank is located or an officer or director of a member of such bank located in that district: <i>Provided</i>, That in any district which includes five or more States the Board may by regulation increase the elective directors to a number not exceeding thirteen and may increase the appointive directors to a number not exceeding three-fourths the number of elective directors: <i>Provided further</i>, That if at any time the number of elective directors in the case of any district is not at least equal to the number of States in such district the Board shall exercise the authority conferred by the next preceding proviso so as to increase such elective directors to a number at least equal to the number of States in such district. At least 2 of the Federal Home Loan Bank directors who are appointed by the Board shall be representatives chosen from organizations with more than a 2-year history of representing consumer or community interests on banking services, credit needs, housing, or financial consumer protections. No Federal Home Loan Bank director who is appointed pursuant to this subsection may, during such Bank director's term of office, serve as an officer of any Federal Home Loan Bank or a director or officer of any member of a Bank, or hold shares, or any other financial interest in, any member of a Bank.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Elective directorships; qualifications; nominations and election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each elective directorship shall be designated by the Board as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined. No person who is an officer or director of a member that fails to meet any applicable capital requirement is eligible to hold the office of Federal Home Loan Bank director. As used in this subsection and in subsection (c) of this section, the term "member" means a member of a Federal home loan bank which was a member of such bank at the end of such calendar year.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among States in bank district; designation of State location</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in each separate State in a bank district shall be determined by the Board in the approximate ratio of the percentage of the required stock, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, of the members located in that State at the end of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election to the total required stock, as so determined, of all members of such bank at the end of such year, except that in the case of each State such number shall not be less than one and shall not be more than six. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if at any time the number of elective directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Board shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of elective directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number. Any elective directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Board shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Board to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located. As used in the second sentence of this subsection, the term "total number of elective directorships" means the total number of elective directorships on the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State was located on December 31, 1960, and the term "members" where used for the second time in such sentence means members of such bank.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms; rules and regulations governing nominations and elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term of each director, whether elected or appointed, shall be 3 years. The board of directors of each Federal home loan bank and the Finance Board shall adjust the terms of members first elected or appointed after November 12, 1999, to ensure that the terms of the members of the board of directors are staggered with approximately 1/3 of the terms expiring each year. If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as an elective director of a Federal home loan bank in any elective directorship or elective directorships and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to an elective directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of existing terms; directorship for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each term, outstanding on the effective date of the amendment to this section abolishing the division of elective directors into classes, of an elective or appointive directorship then existing shall continue until its original date of expiration, and any elective or appointive directorship in existence on said date shall continue to exist to the same extent as if it had been established by or under this section on or after said date. The Board in its discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment. The term "States" or "State" as used in this section shall mean the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Board, by regulation or otherwise, may add an additional elective directorship to the board of directors of the bank of any district in which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is included at the time such directorship is added and which does not then include five or more States, may fix the commencement and the duration, which shall not exceed two years, of the initial term of any directorship so added, and may fill any such initial term by appointment: <i>Provided</i>, That (1) any directorship added pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be designated by the Board, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as representing the members located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, (2) such designation of such directorship shall not be changed, and (3) such directorship shall automatically cease to exist if and when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ceases to be included in such district.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall cause to be made from time to time examinations of the laws of the various States of the United States and the regulations and procedure thereunder governing conditions under which institutions of the kinds which may become members or nonmember borrowers under this chapter are permitted to be formed or to do business, or relating to the conveying or recording of land titles, or to homestead and other rights, or to the enforcement of the rights of holders of mortgages on lands securing loans, or otherwise. If any such examination shall indicate, in the opinion of the Board, that under the laws of any such State or the regulations or procedure thereunder there would be inadequate protection to a Federal Home Loan Bank in making or collecting advances under this chapter, the Board may withhold or limit the operation of any Federal Home Loan Bank in such State until satisfactory conditions of law, regulation, or procedure shall be established. In any State where State examination of members or nonmember borrowers is deemed inadequate for the purposes of the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Board shall establish such examination, all or part of the cost of which may be considered as part of the cost of making advances in such State. The banks and/or the Board may make studies of trends of home and other property values, methods of appraisals, and other subjects such as they may deem useful for the general guidance of their policies and operations and those of institutions authorized to secure advances.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make secured advances to its members upon collateral sufficient, in the judgment of the Bank, to fully secure advances obtained from the Bank under this section or <uscode detail="(g)" edition="1999" section="1431" title="12">section 1431(g) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A long-term advance may only be made for the purposes of—</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional bank authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (3) shall not affect the ability of any Federal Home Loan Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its security position with respect to outstanding advances, including requiring deposits of additional collateral security, whether or not such additional security would be eligible to originate an advance. If an advance existing on August 9, 1989, matures and the member does not have sufficient eligible collateral to fully secure a renewal of such advance, a Bank may renew such advance secured by such collateral as the Bank determines is appropriate. A member that has an advance secured by such insufficient eligible collateral must reduce its level of outstanding advances promptly and prudently in accordance with a schedule determined by the Federal home loan bank.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of certain collateral standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may review the collateral standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank for the classes of collateral described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (3), and may, if necessary for safety and soundness purposes, require an increase in the collateral standards for any or all of those classes of collateral.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notes of borrowing members; interest rate; lien on stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such advances shall be made upon the note or obligation of the member secured as provided in this section, bearing such rate of interest as the Federal home loan bank may approve or determine, and the Federal Home Loan Bank shall have a lien upon and shall hold the stock of such member as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation to repay; additional security; sale of advances to other banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The institution applying for an advance shall enter into a primary and unconditional obligation to pay off all advances, together with interest and any unpaid costs and expenses in connection therewith according to the terms under which they were made, in such form as shall meet the requirements of the bank. The bank shall reserve the right to require at any time, when deemed necessary for its protection, deposits of additional collateral security or substitutions of security by the borrowing institution, and each borrowing institution shall assign additional or substituted security when and as so required. Any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to sell to any other Federal Home Loan Bank, with or without recourse, any advance made under the provisions of this chapter, or to allow to such bank a participation therein, and any other Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to purchase such advance or to accept a participation therein, together with an appropriate assignment of security therefor.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority of certain secured interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member shall be entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than claims and rights that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and</p>
