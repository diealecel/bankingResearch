<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (referred to in this section collectively as the "enterprises"), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (referred to in this section as the "Banks"), have important public missions that are reflected in the statutes and charter Acts establishing the Banks and the enterprises;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because the continued ability of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to accomplish their public missions is important to providing housing in the United States and the health of the Nation's economy, more effective Federal regulation is needed to reduce the risk of failure of the enterprises;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) considering the current operating procedures of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, the enterprises and the Banks currently pose low financial risk of insolvency;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) neither the enterprises nor the Banks, nor any securities or obligations issued by the enterprises or the Banks, are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an entity regulating the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation should have sufficient autonomy from the enterprises and special interest groups;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an entity regulating such enterprises should have the authority to establish capital standards, require financial disclosure, prescribe adequate standards for books and records and other internal controls, conduct examinations when necessary, and enforce compliance with the standards and rules that it establishes;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_8"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the Federal Home Loan Bank Act [<uscode edition="2010" section="1421" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.</uscode>] should be amended to emphasize that providing for financial safety and soundness of the Federal Home Loan Banks is the primary mission of the Federal Housing Finance Board.</p>

The approval of an agreement or contract pursuant to <uscode detail="(d)(3)(B)" edition="2010" section="1723a" title="12">section 1723a(d)(3)(B) of this title</uscode> or <uscode detail="(h)(2)" edition="2010" section="1452" title="12">section 1452(h)(2) of this title</uscode> shall not preclude the Director from making any subsequent determination under subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of goal</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Measurement of performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of <uscode edition="2010" section="4566" title="12">section 4566 of this title</uscode>) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2010" section="4561" title="12">section 4561(a) of this title</uscode>, whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director determines that the actions specified in the notice of charges served upon a regulated entity or any entity-affiliated party pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2010" section="4631" title="12">section 4631(a) of this title</uscode>, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of that entity, or is likely to weaken the condition of that entity prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to <uscode edition="2010" range="4631 and 4633" section="4631" title="12">sections 4631 and 4633 of this title</uscode>, the Director may—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">An order issued under paragraph (1) may include any requirement authorized under sub<uscode detail="(d)" edition="2010" section="4631" title="12">section 4631(d) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall become effective upon service upon the regulated entity, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings pursuant to such notice and shall remain effective until the Director dismisses the charges specified in the notice or until superseded by a cease-and-desist order issued pursuant to <uscode edition="2010" section="4631" title="12">section 4631 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a notice of charges served under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title specifies on the basis of particular facts and circumstances that the books and records of the regulated entity served are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Director is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of the regulated entity or the details or the purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that regulated entity, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1_A"></a>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any temporary order issued under paragraph (1)—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the completion of the proceeding initiated under <uscode edition="2010" section="4631" title="12">section 4631 of this title</uscode> in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_2_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the date the Director determines, by examination or otherwise, that the books and records of the regulated entity are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the regulated entity.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A regulated entity, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party that has been served with a temporary order pursuant to this section may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia within 10 days after such service for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the enterprise, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title. Such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary order issued pursuant to this section, the Director may bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an injunction to enforce such order. If the court finds any such violation, threatened violation, or failure to obey, the court shall issue such injunction.</p>
