<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this chapter to improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular by establishing a program to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this policy shall be carried out in such manner as to insure the maximum participation of private financing sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intention of the Congress that the provisions of this chapter shall be so administered that any financial assistance provided hereunder shall not result in a substantial increase of unemployment in any area of the country. It is the intention of the Congress that in the award of financial assistance under this chapter, when practicable, priority be accorded to small business concerns which lease or purchase equipment and supplies which are produced in the United States and that small business concerns receiving such assistance be encouraged to continue to lease or purchase such equipment and supplies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the private capital of each licensee shall be not less than—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $5,000,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $10,000,000, with respect to each licensee authorized or seeking authority to issue participating securities to be purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may, in the discretion of the Administrator and based on a showing of special circumstances and good cause, permit the private capital of a licensee authorized or seeking authorization to issue participating securities to be purchased or guaranteed by the Administration to be less than $10,000,000, but not less than $5,000,000, if the Administrator determines that such action would not create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adequacy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine whether the private capital of each licensee is adequate to assure a reasonable prospect that the licensee will be operated soundly and profitably, and managed actively and prudently in accordance with its articles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine that the licensee will be able<sup><a href="#682_1_target" name="682_1">1</a></sup> both prior to licensing and prior to approving any request for financing, to make periodic payments on any debt of the company which is interest bearing and shall take into consideration the income which the company anticipates on its contemplated investments, the experience of the company's owners and managers, the history of the company as an entity, if any, and the company's financial resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exemption from capital requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may, in the discretion of the Administrator, approve leverage for any licensee licensed under subsection (c) or (d) of <uscode edition="1997" section="681" title="15">section 681 of this title</uscode> before September 30, 1996, that does not meet the capital requirements of paragraph (1), if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the licensee certifies in writing that not less than 50 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of its financings after September 30, 1996, will be provided to smaller enterprises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Administrator determines that such action would not create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale of shares of stock to banking organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1845(a)(1) <sup><a href="#682_2_target" name="682_2">2</a></sup> of title 12, any national bank, or any member bank of the Federal Reserve System or nonmember insured bank to the extent permitted under applicable State law, may invest in any 1 or more small business investment companies, or in any entity established to invest solely in small business investment companies, except that in no event shall the total amount of such investments of any such bank exceed 5 percent of the capital and surplus of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Diversification of ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall ensure that the management of each licensee licensed after September 30, 1996, is sufficiently diversified from and unaffiliated with the ownership of the licensee in a manner that ensures independence and objectivity in the financial management and oversight of the investments and operations of the licensee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to issue obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each small business investment company shall have authority to borrow money and to issue its securities, promissory notes, or other obligations under such general conditions and subject to such limitations and regulations as the Administration may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Debentures and participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To encourage the formation and growth of small business investment companies the Administration is authorized when authorized in appropriation Acts, to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on, debentures or participating securities issued by such companies. Such purchases or guarantees may be made by the Administration on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, pursuant to regulations issued by the Administration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. Debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this subsection shall be subordinate to any other debenture bonds, promissory notes, or other debts and obligations of such companies, unless the Administration in its exercise of reasonable investment prudence and in considering the financial soundness of such company determines otherwise. Such debentures may be issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years and shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such debentures, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus an additional charge of 1 percent per annum which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration. The debentures or participating securities shall also contain such other terms as the Administration may fix, and shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The total amount of debentures and participating securities that may be guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding from a company licensed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1997" section="681" title="15">section 681(c) of this title</uscode> shall not exceed 300 per centum of the private capital of such company: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall require any such company that on March 31, 1993, has outstanding debentures in excess of 300 per centum of its private capital to prepay such excess: <em>And provided further</em>, That any such company may apply for an additional debenture guarantee or participating security guarantee with the proceeds to be used solely to pay the amount due on such maturing debenture, but the maturity of the new debenture or security shall be not later than September 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) After March 31, 1993, the maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to a company licensed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1997" section="681" title="15">section 681(c) of this title</uscode> shall be determined by the amount of such company's private capital—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the company has private capital of not more than $15,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed 300 per centum of private capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the company has private capital of more than $15,000,000 but not more than $30,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed $45,000,000 plus 200 per centum of the amount of private capital over $15,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the company has private capital of more than $30,000,000, the total amount of leverage shall not exceed $75,000,000 plus 100 per centum of the amount of private capital over $30,000,000 but not to exceed an additional $15,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) The dollar amounts in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The initial adjustments made under this subparagraph after December 2, 1997, shall reflect only increases from March 31, 1993.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Subject to the foregoing dollar and percentage limits, a company licensed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1997" section="681" title="15">section 681(c) of this title</uscode> may issue and have outstanding both guaranteed debentures and participating securities: <em>Provided</em>, That the total amount of participating securities outstanding shall not exceed 200 per centum of private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Maximum aggregate amount of leverage.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate amount of outstanding leverage issued to any company or companies that are commonly controlled (as determined by the Administrator) may not exceed $90,000,000, as adjusted annually for increases in the Consumer Price Index.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.—The Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) approve an amount of leverage that exceeds the amount described in subparagraph (A) for companies under common control; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) impose such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator determines to be appropriate to minimize the risk of loss to the Administration in the event of default.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of other provisions</cap-smallcap>.—Any leverage that is issued to a company or companies commonly controlled in an amount that exceeds $90,000,000, whether as a result of an increase in the Consumer Price Index or a decision of the Administrator, is subject to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<!-- PDFPage:730 --><p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, the term “venture capital” includes such common stock, preferred stock, or other financing with subordination or nonamortization characteristics as the Administration determines to be substantially similar to equity financing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Third party debt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall not permit a licensee having outstanding leverage to incur third party debt that would create or contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall permit such licensees to incur third party debt only on such terms and subject to such conditions as may be established by the Administrator, by regulation or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required certifications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall require each licensee, as a condition of approval of an application for leverage, to certify in writing—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for licensees with leverage less than or equal to $90,000,000, that not less than 20 percent of the licensee's aggregate dollar amount of financings will be provided to smaller enterprises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for licensees with leverage in excess of $90,000,000, that, in addition to satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (A), 100 percent of the licensee's aggregate dollar amount of financings made in whole or in part with leverage in excess of $90,000,000 will be provided to smaller enterprises (as defined in <uscode detail="(12)" edition="1997" section="662" title="15">section 662(12) of this title</uscode>).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple licensees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Multiple licensees under common control (as determined by the Administrator) shall be considered to be a single licensee for purposes of determining both the applicability of and compliance with the investment percentage requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Capital impairment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before approving any application for leverage submitted by a licensee under this chapter, the Administrator—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall determine that the private capital of the licensee meets the requirements of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="1997" section="682" title="15">section 682(a) of this title</uscode>; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall determine, taking into account the nature of the assets of the licensee, the amount and terms of any third party debt owed by such licensee, and any other factors determined to be relevant by the Administrator, that the private capital of the licensee has not been impaired to such an extent that the issuance of additional leverage would create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Redemption or repurchase of preferred stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Administrator may allow the issuer of any preferred stock sold to the Administration before November 1, 1989 to redeem or repurchase such stock, upon the payment to the Administration of an amount less than the par value of such stock, for a repurchase price determined by the Administrator after consideration of all relevant factors, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the market value of the stock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of benefits provided and anticipated to accrue to the issuer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of dividends paid, accrued, and anticipated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the estimate of the Administrator of any anticipated redemption; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any moneys received by the Administration from the repurchase of preferred stock shall be available solely to provide debenture leverage to licensees having 50 percent or more in aggregate dollar amount of their financings invested in smaller enterprises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guarantee of payment of and authority to purchase participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage small business investment companies to provide equity capital to small businesses, the Administration is authorized to guarantee the payment of the redemption price and prioritized payments on participating securities issued by such companies which are licensed pursuant to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="1997" section="681" title="15">section 681(c) of this title</uscode>, and a trust or a pool acting on behalf of the Administration is authorized to purchase such securities. Such guarantees and purchases shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Administration shall establish by regulation. For purposes of this section, (A) the term “participating securities” includes preferred stock, a preferred limited partnership interest or a similar instrument, including debentures under the terms of which interest is payable only to the extent of earnings and (B) the term “prioritized payments” includes dividends on stock, interest on qualifying debentures, or priority returns on preferred limited partnership interests which are paid only to the extent of earnings. Participating securities guaranteed under this subsection shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations, in addition to such other restrictions and limitations as the Administration may determine:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Participating securities shall be redeemed not later than 15 years after their date of issuance for an amount equal to 100 per centum of the original issue price plus the amount of any accrued prioritized payment: <em>Provided</em>, That if, at the time the securities are redeemed, whether as scheduled or in advance, the issuing company (A) has not paid all accrued prioritized payments in full as provided in paragraph (2) below and (B) has not sold or otherwise disposed of all investments subject to profit distributions pursuant to paragraph (11), the company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall continue and payment shall be made from the realized gain, if any, on the disposition of such investments, but if on disposition there is no realized gain, the obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall be extinguished: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the interim, the company shall not make any in-kind distributions of such investments unless it pays to the Administration such sums, up to the amount of the unrealized appreciation on such investments, as may be necessary to pay in full the accrued prioritized payments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:731 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prioritized payments on participating securities shall be preferred and cumulative and payable out of the retained earnings available for distribution, as defined by the Administration, of the issuing company at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such securities, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus an additional charge of 1 percent per annum which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the event of liquidation of the company, participating securities shall be senior in priority for all purposes to all other equity interests in the issuing company, whenever created.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any company issuing a participating security under this subsection shall commit to invest or shall invest an amount equal to the outstanding face value of such security solely in equity capital. As used in this subsection, “equity capital” means common or preferred stock or a similar instrument, including subordinated debt with equity features which is not amortized and which provides for interest payments contingent upon and limited to the extent of earnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The only debt (other than leverage obtained in accordance with this subchapter) which any company issuing a participating security under this subsection may have outstanding shall be temporary debt in amounts limited to not more than 50 per centum of private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Administration may permit the proceeds of a participating security to be used to pay the principal amount due on outstanding debentures guaranteed by the Administration, if (A) the company has outstanding equity capital invested in an amount equal to the amount of the debentures being refinanced and (B) the Administration receives profit participation on such terms and conditions as it may determine, but not to exceed the per centums specified in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) For purposes of computing profit participation under paragraph (11), except as otherwise determined by the Administration, the management expenses of any company which issues participating securities shall not be greater than 2.5 per centum per annum of the combined capital of the company, plus $125,000 if the company's combined capital is less than $20,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) the term “combined capital” means the aggregate amount of private capital and outstanding leverage and (B) the term “management expenses” includes salaries, office expenses, travel, business development, office and equipment rental, bookkeeping and the development, investigation and monitoring of investments, but does not include the cost of services provided by specialized outside consultants, outside lawyers and outside auditors, who perform services not generally expected of a venture capital company nor does such term include the cost of services provided by any affiliate of the company which are not part of the normal process of making and monitoring venture capital investments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Notwithstanding paragraph (9), if a company is operating as a limited partnership or as a subchapter s <sup><a href="#683_1_target" name="683_1">1</a></sup> corporation or an equivalent pass-through entity for tax purposes and if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments, the company may make annual distributions to the partners, shareholders, or members in amounts not greater than each partner's, shareholder's, or member's maximum tax liability. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “maximum tax liability” means the amount of income allocated to each partner, shareholder, or member (including an allocation to the Administration as if it were a taxpayer) for Federal income tax purposes in the income tax return filed or to be filed by the company with respect to the fiscal year of the company immediately preceding such distribution, multiplied by the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rates for corporations or individuals, whichever is higher, on each type of income included in such return. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “State income tax” means the income tax of the State where the company's principal place of business is located. A company may also elect to make a distribution under this paragraph at the end of any calendar quarter based on a quarterly estimate of the maximum tax liability. If a company makes 1 or more quarterly distributions for a calendar year, and the aggregate amount of those distributions exceeds the maximum amount that the company could have distributed based on a single annual computation, any subsequent distribution by the company under this paragraph shall be reduced by an amount equal to the excess amount distributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) After making any distributions as provided in paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may distribute the balance of income to its investors, specifically including the Administration, in the per centums specified in paragraph (11), if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, any amounts distributed shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of leverage to private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 100 per centum but not more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, 50 per centum of any amounts distributed shall be made to the Administration and 50 per centum shall be made to the private investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the amount of leverage outstanding is 100 per centum, or less, of the amount of <!-- PDFPage:732 -->private capital, the ratio shall be that for distribution of profits as provided in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any amounts received by the Administration under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be applied first as profit participation as provided in paragraph (11) and any remainder shall be applied as a prepayment of the principal amount of the participating securities or debentures.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) After making any distributions pursuant to paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may return capital to its investors, specifically including the Administration, if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full. Any distributions under this paragraph shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of private capital to leverage as of the date of the proposed distribution: <em>Provided</em>, That if the amount of leverage outstanding is less than 50 per centum of the amount of private capital or $10,000,000, whichever is less, no distribution shall be required to be made to the Administration unless the Administration determines, on a case by case basis, to require distributions to the Administration to reduce the amount of outstanding leverage to an amount less than $10,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) A company which issues participating securities shall agree to allocate to the Administration a share of its profits determined by the relationship of its private capital to the amount of participating securities guaranteed by the Administration in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If the total amount of participating securities is 100 per centum of private capital or less, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows: the amount of participating securities divided by private capital times 9 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If the total amount of participating securities is more than 100 per centum but not greater than 200 per centum of private capital, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 9 per centum, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) 3 per centum of the amount of participating securities minus private capital divided by private capital.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in no event shall the total per centum required by this paragraph exceed 12 per centum, unless required pursuant to the provisions of (ii) below,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if, on the date the participating securities are marketed, the interest rate on Treasury bonds with a maturity of 10 years is a rate other than 8 per centum, the Administration shall adjust the rate specified in paragraph (A) above, either higher or lower, by the same per centum by which the Treasury bond rate is higher or lower than 8 per centum, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) this paragraph shall not be construed to create any ownership interest of the Administration in the company.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) A company may elect to make an in-kind distribution of securities only if such securities are publicly traded and marketable. The company shall deposit the Administration's share of such securities for disposition with a trustee designated by the Administration or, at its option and with the agreement of the company, the Administration may direct the company to retain the Administration's share. If the company retains the Administration's share, it shall sell the Administration's share and promptly remit the proceeds to the Administration. As used in this paragraph, the term “trustee” means a person who is knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) <cap-smallcap>Participating securities for smaller small business investment companies.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), of the amount of the annual program level of participating securities approved in appropriations Acts, 50 percent shall be reserved for funding small business investment companies with private capital of not more than $20,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.—During the last quarter of each fiscal year, if the Administrator determines that there is a lack of qualified applicants with private capital of not more than $20,000,000, the Administrator may utilize all or any part of the program level for securities reserved under subparagraph (A) for qualified applicants with private capital of more than $20,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Computation of amounts due under participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The computation of amounts due the Administration under participating securities shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The formula in subsection (g)(11) of this section shall be computed annually and the Administration shall receive distributions of its profit participation at the same time as other investors in the company.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§687a. Revocation and suspension of licenses; cease and desist orders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grounds for suspension or revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A license may be revoked or suspended by the Administration—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for false statements knowingly made in any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administrator, fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which the statement was made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any rule or regulation of the Administration authorized by this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for violation of, or failure to observe, any cease and desist order issued by the Administration under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grounds for cease and desist order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a licensee or any other person has not complied with any provision of this chapter, or of any regulation issued pursuant thereto by the Administration, or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of such chapter or regulation, the Administration may order such licensee or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administration may further order such licensee or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administration deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter and the regulations. The Administration may also suspend the license of a licensee, against whom an order has been issued, until such licensee complies with such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order to show cause; contents; hearing; issuance and service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before revoking or suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Administration shall serve upon the licensee and any other person involved an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee and any other person involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subpena of person, and books, papers and documents; fees and mileage; enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, and documents relating to the hearing from any place in the United States. Witnesses summoned before the Administration shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Administration, or any party to a proceeding before the Administration, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition to modify or set aside order; filing, time and place, Administration to submit record; action of court; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order issued by the Administration under this section shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days after the service thereof the licensee, or other person against whom an order is issued, appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such licensee has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the Administration's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition. After the expiration of such thirty days, a petition <!-- PDFPage:742 -->may be filed only by leave of court on a showing of reasonable grounds for failure to file the petition theretofore. The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Administration, and the Administration shall thereupon certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Administration. If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the Administration to reopen the hearing for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Administration may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the record of such additional evidence. No objection to an order of the Administration shall be considered by the court unless such objection was urged before the Administration or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside any such order of the Administration shall be subject only to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certification or certiorari as provided in <uscode edition="1997" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any licensee or other person against which or against whom an order is issued under this section fails to obey the order, the Administration may apply to the United States court of appeals, within the circuit where the licensee has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of the application the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the licensee or other person. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in subsection (e) of this section for applications to set aside or modify orders.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigation of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such <!-- PDFPage:743 -->attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a licensee, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Examinations and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each small business investment company shall be subject to examinations made by direction of the Investment Division of the Administration, which may be conducted with the assistance of a private sector entity that has both the qualifications to conduct and expertise in conducting such examinations, and the cost of such examinations, including the compensation of the examiners, may in the discretion of the Administration be assessed against the company examined and when so assessed shall be paid by such company. Fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and are authorized to be appropriated solely to cover the costs of examinations and other program oversight activities. Every such company shall make such reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require; except that the Administration is authorized to exempt from making such reports any such company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [<uscode edition="1997" section="80a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 80a</uscode>–1 et seq.] to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in reporting requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examinations of small business investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each small business investment company shall be examined at least every two years in such detail so as to determine whether or not—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it has engaged solely in lawful activities and those contemplated by this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it has engaged in prohibited conflicts of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it has acquired or exercised illegal control of an assisted small business;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Written notice of intention to remove; grounds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may serve upon any director or officer of a licensee a written notice of its intention to remove him from office whenever, in the opinion of the Administration, such director or officer—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has willfully and knowingly committed any substantial violation of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) this chapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any regulation issued under this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has willfully and knowingly committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice which constitutes a substantial breach of his fiduciary duty as such director or officer,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">and that such violation or such breach of fiduciary duty is one involving personal dishonesty on the part of such director or officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension pending completion of administrative proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In respect to any director or officer referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Administration may, if it deems it necessary for the protection of the licensee or the interests of the Administration, by written notice to such effect served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall become effective upon service of such notice and, unless stayed by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served under subsection (a) of this section and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or, if an order of removal and/or prohibition is issued against the director or officer, until the effective date of any such order. Copies of any such notice shall also be served upon the interested licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Hearing; order of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A notice of intention to remove a director or officer, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds therefor, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Administration at the request of (1) such director or officer and for good cause shown, or (2) the Attorney General of the United States. Unless such director or officer shall appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of such removal. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record <!-- PDFPage:746 -->made at any such hearing the Administration shall find that any of the grounds specified in such notice has been established, the Administration may issue such orders of removal from office as it deems appropriate. Any such order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after service upon such licensee and the director or officer concerned (except in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein). Such order shall remain effective and enforcible except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Administration or a reviewing court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Stay by United States district court of suspension or prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within ten days after any director or officer has been suspended from office and/or prohibited from participation in the conduct of the affairs of a licensee under subsection (b) of this section, such director or officer may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the licensee is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for a stay of such suspension and/or prohibition pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served upon such director or officer under subsection (a) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to stay such suspension and/or prohibition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspension of directors and officers charged with felonies involving dishonesty or breach of trust; notice; duration of suspension; removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any director or officer of a licensee is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the Administration may, by written notice served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Administration. In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such offense is entered against such director or officer, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Administration may issue and serve upon such director or officer an order removing him from office. A copy of such order shall be served upon such licensee, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such licensee. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to suspend or remove such director or officer from office and/or to prohibit him from further participation in licensee affairs, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Hearings; procedure; form and requisites of decision; review; stay of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any hearing provided for in this section shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the principal office of the licensee is located unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of <uscode chapter="5" edition="1997" title="5">chapter 5 of title 5</uscode>. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, the Administration shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and cause to be served upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any party to such proceeding may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the director or officer concerned, or an order issued under subsection (e) of this section), by filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the licensee is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Administration be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Administration, and thereupon the Administration shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in <uscode edition="1997" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall, except as provided in the last sentence of said paragraph (1), be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Administration. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in <uscode chapter="7" edition="1997" title="5">chapter 7 of title 5</uscode>. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided in <uscode edition="1997" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The commencement of proceedings for judicial review under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Administration.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonavailability of guarantees from other sources; participation with qualified sureties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may, whenever it determines such action to be necessary or desirable, and upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, guarantee the payment of rentals under leases of commercial and industrial property entered into by small business concerns to enable such concerns to obtain such leases. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration (A) if a guarantee meeting the requirements of the applicant is otherwise available on reasonable terms, and (B) unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the lease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administration shall, to the greatest extent practicable, exercise the powers conferred by this section in cooperation with qualified surety or other companies on a participation basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform annual fee; processing fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for its share of any guarantee under this section which shall be payable in advance at such time as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The amount of any such fee shall be determined in accordance with sound actuarial practices and procedures, to the extent practicable, but in no case shall such amount exceed, on the Administration's share of any guarantee made under this part, 21/2 per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any guaranteed lease: <em>Provided</em>, That the Administration shall fix the lowest fee that experience under the program established hereby has shown to be justified. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Escrow; default; additional discretionary provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any lease pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the minimum guaranteed annual rental required under the lease, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the lease, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the lease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that upon occurrence of a default under the lease, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the lease guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonably diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the commercial or industrial property covered by the lease to another qualified tenant, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that any guarantor of the lease will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this part, as the Administrator may in his discretion require.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) “pollution control facilities” means such property (both real and personal) as the Administration in its discretion determines is likely to help prevent, reduce, abate, or control noise, air or water pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing or storing pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, and such property (both real and personal) as the Administration determines will be used for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or final disposal of solid or liquid waste.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) “person” includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, joint stock companies, States, territories, and possessions of the United States, or subdivisions of any of the foregoing, and the District of Columbia, as well as individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) “qualified contract” means a lease, sublease, loan agreement, installment sales contract, or similar instrument, entered into between a small business concern and any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Financing disadvantage; guarantee of payment by Administration; restrictions and limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may, whenever it determines that small business concerns are or are likely to be at an operational or financing disadvantage with other business concerns with respect to the planning, design, or installation of pollution control facilities, or the obtaining of financing therefor (including financing by means of revenue bonds issued by States, political subdivisions thereof, or other public bodies), guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation or fiscal policy to the contrary, the guarantee authorized in the case of pollution control facilities or property shall be issued when such property is acquired by the use of proceeds from industrial revenue bonds which provide the holders interest which is exempt from Federal income tax, and the Administration is expressly prohibited from denying such guarantee due to the property being so acquired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any such guarantee shall be for the full amount of the payments due under such qualified contract and shall be a full faith and credit obligation of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the qualified contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Uniform annual fees; processing fees; time and condition for payment; periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for any guarantee issued under this section which shall be payable at such time and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The fee shall be set at an amount which the Administration deems reasonable and necessary and shall be subject to periodic review in order that the lowest fee that experience under the program shows to be justified will be placed into effect. In no case shall such amount be less than 1 per centum or more than 31/2 per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any qualified contract guaranteed under this section. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements of Administration; escrow; default; discretionary provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any qualified contract pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the average annual payments for which a guarantee is issued under <!-- PDFPage:752 -->this section, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the qualified contract, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the qualified contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that upon occurrence of a default under the qualified contract, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the qualified contract guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonable diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the property covered by the qualified contract to another qualified lessee, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that any guarantor of the qualified contract will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this section as the Administrator may in his discretion require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignment of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee issued under this section may be assigned with the permission of the Administration by the person to whom the payments under qualified contracts are due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application of <uscode edition="1997" section="693" title="15">section 693 of this title</uscode></h4>
<p class="statutory-body"><uscode edition="1997" section="693" title="15">Section 693 of this title</uscode> shall apply to the administration of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Administration to guarantee surety against loss from principal's breach of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administration may, upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, guarantee and enter into commitments to guarantee any surety against loss resulting from a breach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, performance bond, or bonds ancillary thereto, by a principal on any contract up to $1,250,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The terms and conditions of said guarantees and commitments may vary from surety to surety on the basis of the Administration's experience with the particular surety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administration may authorize any surety, without further administration approval, to issue, monitor, and service such bonds subject to the Administration's guarantee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No such guarantee may be issued, unless—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the person who would be principal under the bond is a small business concern;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the bond is required in order for such person to bid on a contract, or to serve as a prime contractor or subcontractor thereon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such person is not able to obtain such bond on reasonable terms and conditions without a guarantee under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) there is a reasonable expectation that such principal will perform the covenants and conditions of the contract with respect to which such bond is required, and the terms and conditions of such bond are reasonable in the light of the risks involved and the extent of the surety's participation.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Administration shall promptly act upon an application from a surety to participate in the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program, authorized by paragraph (3), in accordance with criteria and procedures established in regulations pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administration is authorized to reduce the allotment of bond guarantee authority or terminate the participation of a surety in the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program based on the rate of participation of such surety during the 4 most recent fiscal year quarters compared to the median rate of participation by the other sureties in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Indemnification of surety against loss from avoiding breach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this section, in connection with the issuance by the Administration of a guarantee to a surety as provided by subsection (a) of this section, the Administration may agree to indemnify such surety against a loss sustained by such surety in avoiding or attempting to avoid a breach of the terms of a bond guaranteed by the Administration pursuant to subsection (a) of this section: <em>Provided, however—</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prior to making any payment under this subsection, the Administration shall first determine that a breach of the terms of such bond was imminent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a surety must obtain approval from the Administration prior to making any payments pursuant to this subsection unless the surety is participating under the authority of subsection (a)(3) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no payment by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall exceed 10 per centum of the contract price unless the Administrator determines that a greater payment should be made as a result of a finding by the Administrator that the surety's loss sustained in avoiding or attempting to avoid such breach was necessary and reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepayment authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (b) of this section, an issuer of a debenture purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter may, at the election of the borrower (in the case of a loan under <uscode edition="1997" section="697" title="15">section 697 of this title</uscode>) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) and with the approval of the Administration, prepay such debenture in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a prepayment under paragraph (1)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under <uscode edition="1997" section="697" title="15">section 697 of this title</uscode>) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the repurchase premium is the amount equal to the product of—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the applicable percentage rate, as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percentage rate</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The percentage rates described in clause (ii) shall be increased or decreased by the Administration by a factor not to exceed one-third, if the same factor is applied in each case and if the Administration determines that an adjustment is necessary, based on the number of borrowers having given notice of their intent to participate, in order to make the program (including the amounts appropriated for this purpose under <plaw congress="103" isprivate="false" number="317">Public Law 103–317</plaw>) result in no substantial net gain or loss of revenue to the Federal Financing Bank or to the Administration. Amounts collected in excess of the amount necessary to ensure revenue neutrality shall be refunded to the borrowers.</p>
