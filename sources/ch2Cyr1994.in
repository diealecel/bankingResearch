<h3 class="section-head">§79a. Necessity for control of holding companies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interstate nature of holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Public-utility holding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected with a national public interest in that, among other things, (1) their securities are widely marketed and distributed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and are sold to a large number of investors in different States; (2) their service, sales, construction, and other contracts and arrangements are often made and performed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (3) their subsidiary public-utility companies often sell and transport gas and electric energy by the use of means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (4) their practices in respect of and control over subsidiary companies often materially affect the interstate commerce in which those companies engage; (5) their activities extending over many States are not susceptible of effective control by any State and make difficult, if not impossible, effective State regulation of public-utility companies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of investors and interests of consumers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Federal Trade Commission made pursuant to S. Res. 83 (Seventieth Congress, first session), the reports of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, made pursuant to H. Res. 59 (Seventy-second Congress, first session) and H. J. Res. 572 (Seventy-second Congress, second session) and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is declared that the national public interest, the interest of investors in the securities of holding companies and their subsidiary companies and affiliates, and the interest of consumers of electric energy and natural and manufactured gas, are or may be adversely affected—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when such investors cannot obtain the information necessary to appraise the financial position or earning power of the issuers, because of the absence of uniform standard accounts; when such securities are issued without the approval or consent of the States having jurisdiction over subsidiary public-utility companies; when such securities are issued upon the basis of fictitious or unsound asset values having no fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the properties and upon the basis of paper profits from intercompany transactions, or in anticipation of excessive revenues from subsidiary public-utility companies; when such securities are issued by a subsidiary public-utility company under circumstances which subject such company to the burden of supporting an overcapitalized structure and tend to prevent voluntary rate reductions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when subsidiary public-utility companies are subjected to excessive charges for services, construction work, equipment, and materials, or enter into transactions in which evils result from an absence of arm's-length bargaining or from restraint of free and independent competition; when service, management, construction, and other contracts involve the allocation of charges among subsidiary public-utility companies in different States so as to present problems of regulation which cannot be dealt with effectively by the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) when control of subsidiary public-utility companies affects the accounting practices and rate, dividend, and other policies of such companies so as to complicate and obstruct State regulation of such companies, or when control of such companies is exerted through disproportionately small investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) when the growth and extension of holding companies bears no relation to economy of management and operation or the integration and coordination of related operating properties; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) when in any other respect there is lack of economy of management and operation of public-utility companies or lack of efficiency and adequacy of service rendered by such companies, or lack of effective public regulation, or lack of economies in the raising of capital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Declaration of policy of chapter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When abuses of the character above enumerated become persistent and wide-spread the holding company becomes an agency which, unless regulated, is injurious to investors, consumers, and the general public; and it is declared to be the policy of this chapter, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate the evils as enumerated in this section, connected with public-utility holding companies which are engaged in interstate commerce or in activities which directly affect or burden interstate commerce; and for the purpose of effectuating such policy to compel the simplification of public-utility holding-company systems and the elimination therefrom of properties detrimental to the proper functioning of such systems, and to provide as soon as practicable for the elimination of public-utility holding companies except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.</p>

The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare a company operating any such facilities not to be an electric utility company if the Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged in one or more businesses other than the business of an electric utility company, and by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold by such company it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such company be considered an electric utility company for the purposes of this chapter, or (B) such company is one operating within a single State, and substantially all of its outstanding securities are owned directly or indirectly by another company to which such operating company sells or furnishes electric energy which it generates; such other company uses and does not resell such electric energy, is engaged primarily in manufacturing (other than the manufacturing of electric energy or gas) and is not controlled by any other company; and by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold or furnished by such operating company to other persons it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that it be considered an electric utility company for the purposes of this chapter. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company (and the owner of the facilities operated by such company) from the application of this paragraph until the Commission has acted upon such application. As a condition to the entry of any such order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such order, and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports regarding the business of the company as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to insure that such company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application, shall revoke such order whenever it finds that the conditions specified in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph are not satisfied in the case of such company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by the company in respect of which the order is to be issued or by the owner of the facilities operated by such company.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) “Gas utility company” means any company which owns or operates facilities used for the distribution at retail (other than distribution only in enclosed portable containers, or distribution to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale) of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power. The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare a company operating any such facilities not to be a gas utility company if the Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged in one or more businesses other than the business of a gas utility company, and (B) by reason of the small amount of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by such company it is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such company be considered a gas utility company for the purposes of this chapter. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company (and the owner of the facilities operated by such company) from the application of this paragraph until the Commission has acted upon such application. As a condition to the entry of any such order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such order, and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports regarding the business of the company as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to insure that such company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application, shall revoke such order whenever it finds that the conditions specified in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph are not satisfied in the case of such <!-- PDFPage:308 -->company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by the company in respect of which the order is to be issued or by the owner of the facilities operated by such company. Any order issued under this paragraph shall apply equally to such company and such owner. The Commission may by rules or regulations conditionally or unconditionally provide that any specified class or classes of companies which it determines to satisfy the conditions specified in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph, and the owners of the facilities operated by such companies, shall not be deemed gas utility companies within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§79c. Exemptions regarding holding companies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exemption of holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, shall exempt any holding company, and every subsidiary company thereof as such, from any provision or provisions of this chapter, unless and except insofar as it finds the exemption detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such holding company, and every subsidiary company thereof which is a public-utility company from which such holding company derives, directly or indirectly, any material part of its income, are predominantly intrastate in character and carry on their business substantially in a single State in which such holding company and every such subsidiary company thereof are organized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such holding company is predominantly a public-utility company whose operations as such do not extend beyond the State in which it is organized and States contiguous thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such holding company is only incidentally a holding company, being primarily engaged or interested in one or more businesses other than the business of a public-utility company and (A) not deriving, directly or indirectly, any material part of its income from any one or more subsidiary companies, the principal business of which is that of a public-utility company, or (B) deriving a material part of its income from any one or more such subsidiary companies, if substantially all the outstanding securities of such companies are owned, directly or indirectly, by such holding company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such holding company is temporarily a holding company solely by reason of the acquisition of securities for purposes of liquidation or distribution in connection with a bona fide debt previously contracted or in connection with a bona fide arrangement for the underwriting or distribution of securities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such holding company is not, and derives no material part of its income, directly or indirectly, from any one or more subsidiary companies which are, a company or companies the principal business of which within the United States is that of a public-utility company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption of subsidiary companies of holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, shall exempt any subsidiary company, as such, of a holding company from any provision or provisions of this chapter, the application of which to such subsidiary company the Commission finds is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors, if such subsidiary company derives no material part of its income, directly or indirectly, from sources within the United States, and neither it nor any of its subsidiary companies is a public-utility company operating in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Filing for exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within a reasonable time after the receipt of an application for exemption under subsection <!-- PDFPage:312 -->(a) or (b) of this section, the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of such application. The filing of an application in good faith under subsection (a) of this section by a person other than a registered holding company shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this chapter upon the applicant as a holding company until the Commission has acted upon such application. The filing of an application in good faith under subsection (b) of this section shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this chapter upon the applicant as a subsidiary company until the Commission has acted upon such application. Whenever the Commission, on its own motion, or upon application by the holding company or any subsidiary company thereof exempted by any order issued under subsection (a) of this section, or by the subsidiary company exempted by any order issued under subsection (b) of this section, finds that the circumstances which gave rise to the issuance of such order no longer exist, the Commission shall by order revoke such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption of specified class or classes of persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, by rules and regulations, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any specified class or classes of persons from the obligations, duties, or liabilities imposed upon such persons as subsidiary companies or affiliates under any provision or provisions of this chapter, and may provide within the extent of any such exemption that such specified class or classes of persons shall not be deemed subsidiary companies or affiliates within the meaning of any such provision or provisions, if and to the extent that it deems the exemption necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and not contrary to the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemptions from operation of subsection (a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the issue, renewal, or guaranty by a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof of a note or draft (including the pledge of any security as collateral therefor) if such note or draft (1) is not part of a public offering, (2) matures or is renewed for not more than nine months, exclusive of days of grace, after the date of such issue, renewal, or guaranty thereof, and (3) aggregates (together with all other then outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of nine months or less, exclusive of days of grace, as to which such company is primarily or secondarily liable) not more than 5 per centum of the principal amount and par value of the other securities of such company then outstanding, or such greater per centum thereof as the Commission upon application may by order authorize as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. In the case of securities having no principal amount or no par value, the value for the purposes of this subsection shall be the fair market value as of the date of issue. The Commission by rules and regulations or order, subject to such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, shall exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) of this section the issue or sale of any security by any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, if the issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary company and have been expressly authorized by the State commission of the State in which such subsidiary company is organized and doing business, or if the issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary company when such subsidiary company is not a holding company, a public-utility company, an investment company, or a fiscal or financing agency of a holding company, a public utility company, or an investment company. The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the issue, by a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, of a security issued pursuant to the terms of any security outstanding on January 1, 1935, giving the holder of such outstanding security the right to convert such outstanding security into another security of the same issuer or of another person, or giving the right to subscribe to another security of the same issuer or another issuer. Within ten days after any issue, sale, renewal, or guaranty exempted from the application of subsection (a) of this section by or under authority of this subsection, such holding company or subsidiary company thereof shall file with the Commission a certificate of notification in such form and setting forth such of the information required in a declaration under <uscode edition="1994" section="79g" title="15">section 79g of this title</uscode> as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof may file a declaration with the Commission, regarding any of the acts enumerated in subsection (a) of <uscode edition="1994" section="79f" title="15">section 79f of this title</uscode>, in such form as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. Such declaration shall include—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such of the information and documents which are required to be filed in order to register a security under <uscode edition="1994" section="77g" title="15">section 77g of this title</uscode>, as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such additional information, in such form and detail, and such documents regarding the declarant or any associate company thereof, the particular security and compliance with such State laws as may apply to the act in question as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effective date of declaration; order of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A declaration filed under this section shall become effective within such reasonable period of <!-- PDFPage:315 -->time after the filing thereof as the Commission shall fix by rules and regulations or order, unless the Commission prior to the expiration of such period shall have issued an order to the declarant to show cause why such declaration should become effective. Within a reasonable time after an opportunity for hearing upon an order to show cause under this subsection, unless the declarant shall withdraw its declaration, the Commission shall enter an order either permitting such declaration to become effective as filed or amended, or refusing to permit such declaration to become effective. Amendments to a declaration may be made upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions precedent to permitting declaration to become effective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not permit a declaration regarding the issue or sale of a security to become effective unless it finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such security is (A) a common stock having a par value and being without preference as to dividends or distribution over, and having at least equal voting rights with, any outstanding security of the declarant; (B) a bond (i) secured by a first lien on physical property of the declarant, or (ii) secured by an obligation of a subsidiary company of the declarant secured by a first lien on physical property of such subsidiary company, or (iii) secured by any other assets of the type and character which the Commission by rules and regulations or order may prescribe as appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors; (C) a guaranty of, or assumption of liability on, a security of another company; or (D) a receiver's or trustee's certificate duly authorized by the appropriate court or courts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such security is to be issued or sold solely (A) for the purpose of refunding, extending, exchanging, or discharging an outstanding security of the declarant and/or a predecessor company thereof or for the purpose of effecting a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization; (B) for the purpose of financing the business of the declarant as a public-utility company; (C) for the purpose of financing the business of the declarant, when the declarant is neither a holding company nor a public-utility company; and/or (D) for necessary and urgent corporate purposes of the declarant where the requirements of the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection would impose an unreasonable financial burden upon the declarant and are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such security is one the issuance of which was authorized by the company prior to January 1, 1935, and which the Commission by rules and regulations or order authorizes as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions having permission of effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the requirements of subsections (c) and (g) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall permit a declaration regarding the issue or sale of a security to become effective unless the Commission finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the security is not reasonably adapted to the security structure of the declarant and other companies in the same holding-company system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the security is not reasonably adapted to the earning power of the declarant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) financing by the issue and sale of the particular security is not necessary or appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of a business in which the applicant lawfully is engaged or has an interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the fees, commissions, or other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, directly or indirectly, in connection with the issue, sale, or distribution of the security are not reasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of a security that is a guaranty of, or assumption of liability on, a security of another company, the circumstances are such as to constitute the making of such guaranty or the assumption of such liability an improper risk for the declarant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the terms and conditions of the issue or sale of the security are detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Declaration regarding alterations, priorities, voting power, and other rights of security holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the requirements of subsection (g) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall permit a declaration to become effective regarding the exercise of a privilege or right to alter the priorities, preferences, voting power, or other rights of the holders of an outstanding security unless the Commission finds that such exercise of such privilege or right will result in an unfair or inequitable distribution of voting power among holders of the securities of the declarant or is otherwise detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Order permitting declaration to become effective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any order permitting a declaration to become effective may contain such terms and conditions as the Commission finds necessary to assure compliance with the conditions specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Compliance with State laws as condition to permission of effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State commission or State securities commission, having jurisdiction over any of the acts enumerated in subsection (a) of <uscode edition="1994" section="79f" title="15">section 79f of this title</uscode>, shall inform the Commission, upon request by the Commission for an opinion or otherwise, that State laws applicable to the act in question have not been complied with, the Commission shall not permit a declaration regarding the act in question to become effective until and unless the Commission is satisfied that such compliance has been effected.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A person may apply for approval of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, or of any other interest in any business, by filing an ap<!-- PDFPage:317 -->plication in such form as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consumers. Such application shall include—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of the acquisition of securities, such information and copies of such documents as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers in respect of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the security to be acquired, the consideration to be paid therefor, and compliance with such State laws as may apply in respect of the issue, sale, or acquisition thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the outstanding securities of the company whose security is to be acquired, the terms, position, rights, and privileges of each class and the options in respect of any such securities,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the material contracts, not made in the ordinary course of business, and the service, sales, and construction contracts of such company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the securities owned, held, or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) balance sheets and profit and loss statements of such company for not more than the five preceding fiscal years, certified, if required by the rules and regulations of the Commission by an independent public accountant,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions affecting approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the requirements of subsection (f) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall approve the acquisition unless the Commission finds that—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in case of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, the consideration, including all fees, commissions, and other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, to be given, directly or indirectly, in connection with such acquisition is not reasonable or does not bear a fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the utility assets to be acquired or the utility assets underlying the securities to be acquired; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such acquisition will unduly complicate the capital structure of the holding-company system of the applicant or will be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers or the proper functioning of such holding-company system.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may condition its approval of the acquisition of securities of another company upon such a fair offer to purchase such of the other securities of the company whose security is to be acquired as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions barring approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall not approve—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an acquisition of securities or utility assets, or of any other interest, which is unlawful under the provisions of <uscode edition="1994" section="79h" title="15">section 79h of this title</uscode> or is detrimental to the carrying out of the provisions of <uscode edition="1994" section="79k" title="15">section 79k of this title</uscode>; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the acquisition of securities or utility assets of a public-utility or holding company unless the Commission finds that such acquisition will serve the public interest by tending towards the economical and efficient development of an integrated public-utility system. This paragraph shall not apply to the acquisition of securities or utility assets of a public-utility company operating exclusively outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Approval to be granted in reasonable time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within such reasonable time after the filing of an application under this section as the Commission shall fix by rules and regulations or order, the Commission shall enter an order either granting or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying approval of the acquisition unless the applicant shall withdraw its application. Amendments to an application may be made upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:318 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Terms and conditions of order granting approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, in any order approving the acquisition of securities or utility assets, may prescribe such terms and conditions in respect of such acquisition, including the price to be paid for such securities or utility assets, as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with State laws as condition of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not approve any acquisition as to which an application is made under this section unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Commission that such State laws as may apply in respect of such acquisition have been complied with, except where the Commission finds that compliance with such State laws would be detrimental to the carrying out of the provisions of <uscode edition="1994" section="79k" title="15">section 79k of this title</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Commission to examine the corporate structure of every registered holding company and subsidiary company thereof, the relationships among the companies in the holding-company system of every such company and the character of the interests thereof and the properties owned or controlled thereby to determine the extent to which the corporate structure of such holding-company system and the companies therein may be simplified, unnecessary complexities therein eliminated, voting power fairly and equitably distributed among the holders of securities thereof, and the properties and business thereof confined to those necessary or appropriate to the operations of an integrated public-utility system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on operations of holding company systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Commission, as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such action as the Commission shall find necessary to limit the operations of the holding-company system of which such company is a part to a single integrated public-utility system, and to such other businesses as are reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utility system: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commission shall permit a registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional integrated public-utility systems, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) All of such additional systems are located in one State, or in adjoining States, or in a contiguous foreign country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The continued combination of such systems under the control of such holding company is not so large (considering the state of the art and the area or region affected) as to impair the advantages of localized management, efficient operation, or the effectiveness of regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission may permit as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of one or more integrated public-utility systems the retention of an interest in any business (other than the business of a public-utility company as such) which the Commission shall find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and not detrimental to the proper functioning of such system or systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such steps as the Commission shall find necessary to ensure that the corporate structure or continued existence of any company in the holding-company system does not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure, or unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders, of such holding-company system. In carrying out the provisions of this paragraph the Commission shall require each registered holding company (and any company in the same holding-company system with such holding company) to take such action as the Commission shall find necessary in order that such holding company shall cease to be a holding company with respect to each of its subsidiary companies which itself has a subsidiary company which is a holding company. Except for the purpose of fairly and equitably distributing voting power among the security holders of such company, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to require any change in the corporate structure or existence of any company which is not a holding company, or of any company whose principal business is that of a public-utility company.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that the conditions upon which <!-- PDFPage:319 -->the order was predicated do not exist. Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in <uscode edition="1994" section="79x" title="15">section 79x of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Time for compliance with order limiting operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any order under subsection (b) of this section shall be complied with within one year from the date of such order; but the Commission shall, upon a showing (made before or after the entry of such order) that the applicant has been or will be unable in the exercise of due diligence to comply with such order within such time, extend such time for an additional period not exceeding one year if it finds such extension necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court enforcement of order for simplification; appointment of trustee; disposition of assets; reorganization plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) <sup><a href="#79k_1_target" name="79k_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="1994" section="79r" title="15">section 79r of this title</uscode>, to enforce compliance with any order issued under subsection (b) of this section. In any such proceeding, the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for purposes of enforcement of such order, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction, in any such proceeding, to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed. In any proceeding for the enforcement of an order of the Commission issued under subsection (b) of this section, the trustee with the approval of the court shall have power to dispose of any or all of such assets and, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, may make such disposition in accordance with a fair and equitable reorganization plan which shall have been approved by the Commission after opportunity for hearing. Such reorganization plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission, or, subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, by any person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Submission by company of plan for simplification; court enforcement of order of approval; appointment of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with such rules and regulations or order as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, any registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered holding company may, at any time after January 1, 1936, submit a plan to the Commission for the divestment of control, securities, or other assets, or for other action by such company or any subsidiary company thereof for the purpose of enabling such company or any subsidiary company thereof to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall find such plan, as submitted or as modified, necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and fair and equitable to the persons affected by such plan, the Commission shall make an order approving such plan; and the Commission, at the request of the company, may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) <sup><a href="#79k_1_target" name="79k_1">1</a></sup> of <uscode edition="1994" section="79r" title="15">section 79r of this title</uscode>, to enforce and carry out the terms and provisions of such plan. If, upon any such application, the court, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall approve such plan as fair and equitable and as appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this section, the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out the terms and provisions of such plan, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer, under the direction of the court and in accordance with the plan theretofore approved by the court and the Commission, the assets so possessed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Commission as trustee; submission of reorganization plan by Commission or interested party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in a court of the United States, whether under this section or otherwise, in which a receiver or trustee is appointed for any registered holding company, or any subsidiary company thereof, the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee or receiver, subject to the directions and orders of the court, whether or not a trustee or receiver shall theretofore have been appointed, and in any such proceeding the court shall not appoint any person other than the Commission as trustee or receiver without notifying the Commission and giving it an opportunity to be heard before making any such appointment. In no proceeding under this section or otherwise shall the Commission be appointed as trustee or receiver without its express consent. In any such proceeding a reorganization plan for a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof shall not become effective unless such plan shall have been approved by the Commission after opportunity for hearing prior to its submission to the court. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such reorganization plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission or, subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, by any person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations or order as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, require that any or all fees, expenses, and remuneration, to whomsoever paid, in connection with any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, case under <!-- PDFPage:320 -->title 11, or receivership of a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, in any such proceeding, shall be subject to approval by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Solicitation of proxies, powers of attorney, etc., in respect of reorganization plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or permit the use of his or its name to solicit, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, any proxy, consent, authorization, power of attorney, deposit, or dissent in respect of any reorganization plan of a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof under this section, or otherwise, or in respect of any plan under this section for the divestment of control, securities, or other assets, or for the dissolution of any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, unless—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has been proposed by the Commission, or the plan and such information regarding it and its sponsors as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers has been submitted to the Commission by a person having a bona fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in such reorganization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each such solicitation is accompanied or preceded by a copy of a report on the plan which shall be made by the Commission after an opportunity for a hearing on the plan and other plans submitted to it, or by an abstract of such report made or approved by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) each such solicitation is made not in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this subsection or the rules and regulations thereunder shall prevent any person from appearing before the Commission or any court through an attorney or proxy.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracts by holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After April 1, 1936, it shall be unlawful for any registered holding company, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract by which such company undertakes to perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, any associate company thereof which is a public-utility or mutual service company. This provision shall not apply to such transactions, involving special or unusual circumstances or not in the ordinary course of business, as the Commission by rules and regulations or order may conditionally or unconditionally exempt as being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contracts by subsidiary or mutual service companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After April 1, 1936, it shall be unlawful for any subsidiary company of any registered holding company or for any mutual service company, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract by which such company undertakes to perform services or construction work for, or sell goods <!-- PDFPage:323 -->to, any associate company thereof except in accordance with such terms and conditions and subject to such limitations and prohibitions as the Commission by rules and regulations or order shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and to insure that such contracts are performed economically and efficiently for the benefit of such associate companies at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among such companies. This provision shall not apply to such transactions as the Commission by rules and regulations or order may conditionally or unconditionally exempt as being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, if such transactions (1) are with any associate company which does not derive, directly or indirectly, any material part of its income from sources within the United States and which is not a public-utility company operating within the United States, or (2) involve special or unusual circumstances or are not in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination and allocation of costs; duration of contracts; regulation by rules of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rules and regulations and orders of the Commission under this section may prescribe, among other things, such terms and conditions regarding the determination of costs and the allocation thereof among specified classes of companies and for specified classes of service, sales, and construction contracts, the duration of such contracts, the making and keeping of accounts and cost-accounting procedures, the filing of annual and other periodic and special reports, the maintenance of competitive conditions, the disclosure of interests, and similar matters, as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application for approval as mutual service company and nature of business; regulation by rules of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rules and regulations and orders of the Commission under this section shall prescribe, among other things, such terms and conditions regarding the manner in which application may be made for approval as a mutual service company and the granting and continuance of such approval, the nature and enforcement of agreements for the sharing of expenses and distributing of revenues among member companies, and matters relating to such agreements, the nature and types of businesses and transactions in which mutual service companies may engage, and the manner of engaging therein, and the relations and transactions with member companies and affiliates, as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. The Commission shall not approve, or continue the approval of, any company as a mutual service company unless the Commission finds such company is so organized as to ownership, costs, revenues, and the sharing thereof as reasonably to insure the efficient and economical performance of service, sales, or construction contracts by such company for member companies, at cost fairly and equitably allocated among such member companies, at a reasonable saving to member companies over the cost to such companies of comparable contracts performed by independent persons. The Commission, upon its own motion or at the request of a member company or a State commission, may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order require a reallocation or reapportionment of costs among member companies of a mutual service company if it finds the existing allocation inequitable and may require the elimination of a service or services to a member company which does not bear its fair proportion of costs or which, by reason of its size or other circumstances, does not require such service or services. The Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order shall revoke, suspend, or modify the approval given any mutual service company if it finds that such company has persistently violated any provision of this section or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts by affiliate in contravention of rules and regulations of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any affiliate of any public-utility company engaged in interstate commerce, or of any registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract, by which such affiliate undertakes to perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, any such company of which it is an affiliate, in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders regarding reports, accounts, costs, maintenance of competitive conditions, disclosure of interest, duration of contracts, and similar matters, as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to prevent the circumvention of the provisions of this chapter or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contracts by persons engaged in performance of service, sales and construction in contravention of rules of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person whose principal business is the performance of service, sales, or construction contracts for public-utility or holding companies, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract with any public-utility company, or for any such person, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract with any public-utility company engaged in interstate commerce, or with any registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders regarding reports, accounts, costs, maintenance of competitive conditions, disclosure of interest, duration of contracts, and similar matters as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers or to prevent the circumvention of the provisions <!-- PDFPage:324 -->of this chapter or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Investigations and recommendations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, in order to obtain information to serve as a basis for recommending further legislation, shall from time to time conduct investigations regarding the making, performance, and costs of service, sales, and construction contracts with holding companies and subsidiary companies thereof and with public-utility companies, the economies resulting therefrom, and the desirability thereof. The Commission shall report to Congress, from time to time, the results of such investigations, together with such recommendations for legislation as it deems advisable. On the basis of such investigations the Commission shall classify the different types of such contracts and the work done thereunder, and shall make recommendations from time to time regarding the standards and scope of such contracts in relation to public-utility companies of different kinds and sizes and the costs incurred thereunder and economies resulting therefrom. Such recommendations shall be made available to State commissions, public-utility companies, and to the public in such form and at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigations to determine violations, aid in enforcement and as basis for recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, in its discretion, may investigate any facts, conditions, practices, or matters which it may deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder, or to aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, in the prescribing of rules and regulations thereunder, or in obtaining information to serve as a basis for recommending further legislation concerning the matters to which this chapter relates. The Commission may require or permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as it shall determine, as to any or all facts and circumstances concerning a matter which may be the subject of investigation. The Commission, in its discretion, may publish, or make available to State commissions, information concerning any such subject.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:327 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigation of business, financial condition, etc., of companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission upon its own motion or at the request of a State commission may investigate, or obtain any information regarding the business, financial condition, or practices of any registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof or facts, conditions, practices, or matters affecting the relations between any such company and any other company or companies in the same holding-company system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administering oaths; subpenas; examining witnesses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of any investigation or any other proceeding under this chapter, any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by it, is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in any State or in any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court aid to compel giving testimony; penalty for refusal to testify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, and other records. And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who, without just cause, shall fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records, if in his or its power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Injunctions to restrain violations; prosecutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or decree or restraining order shall be granted without bond. The Commission may transmit such evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices to the Attorney General, who, in his discretion, may institute the appropriate criminal proceedings under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mandamus to compel compliance with law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application of the Commission, the district courts of the United States and the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission thereunder.</p>

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by the Commission for that purpose, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in <uscode edition="1994" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Commission shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in <uscode edition="1994" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in determining whether to approve (A) the issue or sale of a security by a registered holding company for purposes other than the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, or (B) other transactions by such registered holding company or by its subsidiaries other than with respect to exempt wholesale generators, the Commission shall not consider the effect of the capitalization or earnings of any subsidiary which is an exempt wholesale generator upon the registered holding company system, unless the approval of the issue or sale or other transaction, together with the effect of such capitalization and earnings, would have a substantial adverse impact on the financial integrity of the registered holding company system;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exemptions for foreign utility companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A foreign utility company shall be exempt from all of the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided under this section, and shall not, for any purpose under this chapter, be deemed to be a public utility company under <uscode detail="(a)(5)" edition="1994" section="79b" title="15">section 79b(a)(5) of this title</uscode>, notwithstanding that the foreign utility company may be a subsidiary company, an affiliate, or an associate company of a holding company or of a public utility company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State commission certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section <sup><a href="#79z-5b_1_target" name="79z-5b_1">1</a></sup> (a)(1) shall not apply or be effective unless every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail electric or gas rates of a public utility company that is an associate company or an affiliate of a company otherwise exempted under section <sup><a href="#79z-5b_1_target" name="79z-5b_1">1</a></sup> (a)(1) (other than a public utility company that is an associate company or an affiliate of a registered holding company) has certified to the Commission that it has the authority and resources to protect ratepayers subject to its jurisdiction and that it intends to exercise its authority. Such certification, upon the filing of a notice by such State commission, may be revised or withdrawn by the State commission prospectively as to any future acquisition. The requirement of State certification shall be deemed satisfied if the relevant State commission had, prior to October 24, 1992, on the basis of prescribed conditions of general applicability, determined that ratepayers of a public utility company are adequately insulated from the effects of diversification and the diversification would not impair the ability of the State commission to regulate effectively the operations of such company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) “Foreign utility company” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term “foreign utility company” means any company that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) owns or operates facilities that are not located in any State and that are used for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale or the distribution at retail of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power, if such company—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) derives no part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale or the distribution at retail of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power, within the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) neither the company nor any of its subsidiary companies is a public utility company operating in the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides notice to the Commission, in such form as the Commission may prescribe, that such company is a foreign utility company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ownership of foreign utility companies by exempt holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter except as provided under this section, a holding company that is exempt under <uscode edition="1994" section="79c" title="15">section 79c of this title</uscode> shall be permitted without condition or limitation under the <sup><a href="#79z-5b_2_target" name="79z-5b_2">2</a></sup> chapter to acquire and maintain an interest in the business of one or more foreign utility companies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Registered holding companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Ownership of foreign utility companies by registered holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter except as otherwise provided under this section, a registered holding company shall be permitted as of October 24, 1992 (without the need to apply for, or receive approval from the Commission) to acquire and hold the securities or an interest in the business, of one or more foreign utility companies. The Commission shall promulgate rules or regulations regarding registered holding companies’ acquisition of interests in foreign utility companies which shall provide for the protection of the customers of a public utility company which is an associate company of a foreign utility company and the maintenance of the financial integrity of the registered holding company system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Issuance of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issuance of securities by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the <!-- PDFPage:337 -->acquisition of a foreign utility company, the guarantee of securities of a foreign utility company by a registered holding company, the entering into service, sales, or construction contracts, and the creation or maintenance of any other relationship between a foreign utility company and a registered holding company, its affiliates and associate companies, shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this chapter (unless otherwise exempted under this chapter, in the case of a transaction with an affiliate or associate company located outside of the United States). Any State commission with jurisdiction over the retail rates of a public utility company which is part of a registered holding company system may make such recommendations to the Commission regarding the registered holding company's relationship to a foreign utility company, and the Commission shall reasonably and fully consider such State recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any interest in the business of 1 or more foreign utility companies, or 1 or more companies organized exclusively to own, directly or indirectly, the securities or other interest in a foreign utility company, shall for all purposes of this chapter, be considered to be—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consistent with the operation of a single integrated public utility system, within the meaning of <uscode edition="1994" section="79k" title="15">section 79k of this title</uscode>; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate, to the operations of an integrated public utility system, within the meaning of <uscode edition="1994" section="79k" title="15">section 79k of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on existing law; no State preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be deemed or construed to limit the authority of any State (including any State regulatory authority) with respect to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any public utility company or holding company subject to such State's jurisdiction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any transaction between any foreign utility company (or any affiliate or associate company thereof) and any public utility company or holding company subject to such State's jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Filing of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A public utility company that is an associate company of a foreign utility company shall file with the Commission such reports (with respect to such foreign utility company) as the Commission may by rules, regulations, or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of acquisitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days after the consummation of the acquisition of an interest in a foreign utility company by an associate company of a public utility company that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates or by such public utility company, such associate company or such public utility company, shall provide notice of such acquisition to every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail electric or gas rates of such public utility company, in such form as may be prescribed by the State commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on assumption of liabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No public utility company that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates shall issue any security for the purpose of financing the acquisition, or for the purposes of financing the ownership or operation, of a foreign utility company, nor shall any such public utility company assume any obligation or liability as guarantor, endorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of a foreign utility company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for holding companies which are predominantly public utility companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (f)(1) of this section shall not apply if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the public utility company that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates is a holding company and is not an affiliate under <uscode detail="(a)(11)(B)" edition="1994" section="79b" title="15">section 79b(a)(11)(B) of this title</uscode> of another holding company or is not subject to regulation as a holding company and has no affiliate as defined in <uscode detail="(a)(11)(A)" edition="1994" section="79b" title="15">section 79b(a)(11)(A) of this title</uscode> that is a public utility company subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) each State commission having jurisdiction with respect to the retail electric and gas rates of such public utility company expressly permits such public utility to engage in a transaction otherwise prohibited under section <sup><a href="#79z-5b_3_target" name="79z-5b_3">3</a></sup> (f)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the transaction (aggregated with all other then-outstanding transactions exempted under this subsection) does not exceed 5 per centum of the then-outstanding total capitalization of the public utility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition on pledging or encumbering utility assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public utility company that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates shall pledge or encumber any utility assets or utility assets of any subsidiary thereof for the benefit of an associate foreign utility company.</p>
