<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the record and reports of the Securities and Exchange Commission made pursuant to section 79z–4 <sup><a href="#80a-1_1_target" name="80a-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title, and facts otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is found that investment companies are affected with a national public interest in that, among other things—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the securities issued by such companies, which constitute a substantial part of all securities publicly offered, are distributed, purchased, paid for, exchanged, transferred, redeemed, and repurchased by use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and in the case of the numerous companies which issue redeemable securities this process of distribution and redemption is continuous;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal activities of such companies—investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities—are conducted by use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including the facilities of national securities exchanges, and constitute a substantial part of all transactions effected in the securities markets of the Nation;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such companies customarily invest and trade in securities issued by, and may dominate and control or otherwise affect the policies and management of, companies engaged in business in interstate commerce;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such companies are media for the investment in the national economy of a substantial part of the national savings and may have a vital effect upon the flow of such savings into the capital markets; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the activities of such companies, extending over many States, their use of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the wide geographic distribution of their security holders, make difficult, if not impossible, effective State regulation of such companies in the interest of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the record and reports of the Securities and Exchange Commission made pursuant to section 79z–4 <sup><a href="#80a-1_1_target" name="80a-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title, and facts otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is declared that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when investors purchase, pay for, exchange, receive dividends upon, vote, refrain from voting, sell, or surrender securities issued by investment companies without adequate, accurate, and explicit information, fairly presented, concerning the character of such securities and the circumstances, policies, and financial responsibility of such companies and their management;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when investment companies are organized, operated, managed, or their portfolio securities are selected, in the interest of directors, officers, investment advisers, depositors, or other affiliated persons thereof, in the interest of underwriters, brokers, or dealers, in the interest of special classes of their security holders, or in the interest of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business, rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies&amp;apos; security holders;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) when investment companies issue securities containing inequitable or discriminatory provisions, or fail to protect the preferences and privileges of the holders of their outstanding securities;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) when the control of investment companies is unduly concentrated through pyramiding or inequitable methods of control, or is inequitably distributed, or when investment companies are managed by irresponsible persons;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) when investment companies, in keeping their accounts, in maintaining reserves, and in computing their earnings and the asset value of their outstanding securities, employ unsound or misleading methods, or are not subjected to adequate independent scrutiny;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_6"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) when investment companies are reorganized, become inactive, or change the character of their business, or when the control or management thereof is transferred, without the consent of their security holders;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the issuance of excessive amounts of senior securities increase unduly the speculative character of their junior securities; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_8"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) when investment companies operate without adequate assets or reserves.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">It is declared that the policy and purposes of this subchapter, in accordance with which the provisions of this subchapter shall be interpreted, are to mitigate and, so far as is feasible, to eliminate the conditions enumerated in this section which adversely affect the national public interest and the interest of investors.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) "Bank" means (A) a depository institution (as defined in <uscode edition="2012" section="1813" title="12">section 1813 of title 12</uscode>) or a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in <uscode edition="2012" section="3101" title="12">section 3101 of title 12</uscode>), (B) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, (C) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of this subchapter, and (D) a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agent of any institution or firm included in clauses (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a_7"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) "Commission" means the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_8"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_a_9"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) "Control" means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.</p>

A natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person within the meaning of this subchapter. Any such presumption may be rebutted by evidence, but except as hereinafter provided, shall continue until a determination to the contrary made by the Commission by order either on its own motion or on application by an interested person. If an application filed hereunder is not granted or denied by the Commission within sixty days after filing thereof, the determination sought by the application shall be deemed to have been temporarily granted pending final determination of the Commission thereon.

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election of directors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall serve as a director of a registered investment company unless elected to that office by the holders of the outstanding voting securities of such company, at an annual or a special meeting duly called for that purpose; except that vacancies occurring between such meetings may be filled in any otherwise legal manner if immediately after filling any such vacancy at least two-thirds of the directors then holding office shall have been elected to such office by the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the company at such an annual or special meeting. In the event that at any time less than a majority of the directors of such company holding office at that time were so elected by the holders of the outstanding voting securities, the board of directors or proper officer of such company shall forthwith cause to be held as promptly as possible and in any event within sixty days a meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing directors to fill any existing vacancies in the board of directors unless the Commission shall by order extend such period. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply to members of an advisory board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing herein shall, however, preclude a registered investment company from dividing its directors into classes if its charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, by-laws, trust indenture, or other instrument or the law under which it is organized, so provides and prescribes the tenure of office of the several classes: <i>Provided</i>, That no class shall be elected for a shorter period than one year or for a longer period than five years and the term of office of at least one class shall expire each year.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Trustees of common-law trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to a common-law trust existing on August 22, 1940, under an indenture of trust which does not provide for the election of trustees by the shareholders. No natural person shall serve as trustee of such a trust, which is registered as an investment company, after the holders of record of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of beneficial interests in such trust have declared that he be removed from that office either by declaration in writing filed with the custodian of the securities of the trust or by votes cast in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">The trustees of such a trust shall promptly call a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of voting upon the question of removal of any such trustee or trustees when requested in writing so to do by the record holders of not less than 10 per centum of the outstanding shares.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever ten or more shareholders of record who have been such for at least six months preceding the date of application, and who hold in the aggregate either shares having a net asset value of at least $25,000 or at least 1 per centum of the outstanding shares, whichever is less, shall apply to the trustees in writing, stating that they wish to communicate with other shareholders with a view to obtaining signatures to a request for a meeting pursuant to this subsection and accompanied by a form of communication and request which they wish to transmit, the trustees shall within five business days after receipt of such application either—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c_1"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_c_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of shareholders of record, and the approximate cost of mailing to them the proposed communication and form of request.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">If the trustees elect to follow the course specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection the trustees, upon the written request of such applicants, accompanied by a tender of the material to be mailed and of the reasonable expenses of mailing, shall, with reasonable promptness, mail such material to all shareholders of record at their addresses as recorded on the books, unless within five business days after such tender the trustees shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement signed by at least a majority of the trustees to the effect that in their opinion either such material contains untrue statements of fact or omits to state facts necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, or would be in violation of applicable law, and specifying the basis of such opinion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">After opportunity for hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, the Commission may, and if demanded by the trustees or by such applicants shall, enter an order either sustaining one or more of such objections or refusing to sustain any of them. If the Commission shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections, or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, the trustees shall mail copies of such material to all shareholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) "Senior security" shall not, in the case of a registered open-end company, include a class or classes or a number of series of preferred or special stock each of which is preferred over all other classes or series in respect of assets specifically allocated to that class or series: <i>Provided</i>, That (A) such company has outstanding no class or series of stock which is not so preferred over all other classes or series, or (B) the only other outstanding class of the issuer's stock consists of a common stock upon which no dividend (other than a liquidating dividend) is permitted to be paid and which in the aggregate represents not more than one-half of 1 per centum of the issuer's outstanding voting securities. For the purpose of insuring fair and equitable treatment of the holders of the outstanding voting securities of each class or series of stock of such company, the Commission may by rule, regulation, or order direct that any matter required to be submitted to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of such company shall not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the holders of such percentage (not exceeding a majority) of the outstanding voting securities of each class or series of stock affected by such matter as shall be prescribed in such rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) "Senior security" defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise provided: "Senior security" means any bond, debenture, note, or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness, and any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends; and "senior security representing indebtedness" means any senior security other than stock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The term "senior security", when used in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, shall not include any promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged, and not intended to be publicly distributed; nor shall such term, when used in this section, include any such promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness in any case where such a loan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5 per centum of the value of the total assets of the issuer at the time when the loan is made. A loan shall be presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed; otherwise it shall be presumed not to be for temporary purposes. Any such presumption may be rebutted by evidence.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) "Asset coverage" defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">"Asset coverage" of a class of senior security representing an indebtedness of an issuer means the ratio which the value of the total assets of such issuer, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness of such issuer. "Asset coverage" of a class of senior security of an issuer which is a stock means the ratio which the value of the total assets of such issuer, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness of such issuer plus the aggregate of the involuntary liquidation preference of such class of senior security which is a stock. The involuntary liquidation preference of a class of senior security which is a stock shall be deemed to mean the amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled on involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to a security junior to it.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Future issuance of stock as voting stock; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or as otherwise required by law, every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company (except a common-law trust of the character described in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="80a-16" title="15">section 80a–16(c) of this title</uscode>) shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock: <i>Provided</i>, That this subsection shall not apply to shares issued pursuant to the terms of any warrant or subscription right outstanding on March 15, 1940, or any firm contract entered into before March 15, 1940, to purchase such securities from such company nor to shares issued in accordance with any rules, regulations, or orders which the Commission may make permitting such issue.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_j"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Securities issued by registered face-amount certificate company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter, it shall be unlawful, after August 22, 1940, for any registered face-amount certificate company—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_j_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to issue, except in accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders as the Commission may prescribe in the public interest or as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors, any security other than (A) a face-amount certificate; (B) a common stock having a par value and being without preference as to dividends or distributions and having at least equal voting rights with any outstanding security of such company; or (C) short-term payment or promissory notes or other indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged and not intended to be publicly offered;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_j_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such company has outstanding any security, other than such face-amount certificates, common stock, promissory notes, or other evidence of indebtedness, to make any distribution or declare or pay any dividend on any capital security in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission may prescribe in the public interest or as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure the financial integrity of such company, to prevent the impairment of the company's ability to meet its obligations upon its face-amount certificates; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_j_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to issue any of its securities except for cash or securities including securities of which such company is the issuer.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_k"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Application of section to companies operating under Small Business Investment Act provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to investment companies operating under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [<uscode edition="2012" section="661" title="15">15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.</uscode>], and the provisions of paragraph (2) of said subsection shall not apply to such companies so long as such class of senior security shall be held or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rules relating to minimum and maximum prices for purchase and sale of securities from investment company; time for resale and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A securities association registered under <uscode edition="2012" section="78o-3" title="15">section 78o–3 of this title</uscode> may prescribe, by rules adopted and in effect in accordance with said section and subject to all provisions of said section applicable to the rules of such an association—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a method or methods for computing the minimum price at which a member thereof may purchase from any investment company any redeemable security issued by such company and the maximum price at which a member may sell to such company any redeemable security issued by it or which he may receive for such security upon redemption, so that the price in each case will bear such relation to the current net asset value of such security computed as of such time as the rules may prescribe; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a minimum period of time which must elapse after the sale or issue of such security before any resale to such company by a member or its redemption upon surrender by a member;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">in each case for the purpose of eliminating or reducing so far as reasonably practicable any dilution of the value of other outstanding securities of such company or any other result of such purchase, redemption, or sale which is unfair to holders of such other outstanding securities; and said rules may prohibit the members of the association from purchasing, selling, or surrendering for redemption any such redeemable securities in contravention of said rules.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules relating to purchase of securities by members from issuer investment company</h4>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Such a securities association may also, by rules adopted and in effect in accordance with <uscode edition="2012" section="78o-3" title="15">section 78o–3 of this title</uscode>, and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b)(6) thereof but subject to all other provisions of said section applicable to the rules of such an association, prohibit its members from purchasing, in connection with a primary distribution of redeemable securities of which any registered investment company is the issuer, any such security from the issuer or from any principal underwriter except at a price equal to the price at which such security is then offered to the public less a commission, discount, or spread which is computed in conformity with a method or methods, and within such limitations as to the relation thereof to said public offering price, as such rules may prescribe in order that the price at which such security is offered or sold to the public shall not include an excessive sales load but shall allow for reasonable compensation for sales personnel, broker-dealers, and underwriters, and for reasonable sales loads to investors. The Commission shall on application or otherwise, if it appears that smaller companies are subject to relatively higher operating costs, make due allowance therefor by granting any such company or class of companies appropriate qualified exemptions from the provisions of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At any time after the expiration of eighteen months from December 14, 1970 (or, if earlier, after a securities association has adopted for purposes of paragraph (1) any rule respecting excessive sales loads), the Commission may alter or supplement the rules of any securities association as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection in the manner provided by <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="78s" title="15">section 78s(c) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any provision of this subsection is in conflict with any provision of any law of the United States in effect on December 14, 1970, the provisions of this subsection shall prevail.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conflicting rules of Commission and associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company, whether or not members of any securities association, to the same extent, covering the same subject matter, and for the accomplishment of the same ends as are prescribed in subsection (a) of this section in respect of the rules which may be made by a registered securities association governing its members. Any rules and regulations so made by the Commission, to the extent that they may be inconsistent with the rules of any such association, shall so long as they remain in force supersede the rules of the association and be binding upon its members as well as all other underwriters and dealers to whom they may be applicable.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sale of securities except to or through principal underwriter; price of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registered investment company shall sell any redeemable security issued by it to any person except either to or through a principal underwriter for distribution or at a current public offering price described in the prospectus, and, if such class of security is being currently offered to the public by or through an underwriter, no principal underwriter of such security and no dealer shall sell any such security to any person except a dealer, a principal underwriter, or the issuer, except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a sale made (i) pursuant to an offer of exchange permitted by <uscode edition="2012" section="80a-11" title="15">section 80a–11 of this title</uscode> including any offer made pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2012" section="80a-11" title="15">section 80a–11(b) of this title</uscode>; (ii) pursuant to an offer made solely to all registered holders of the securities, or of a particular class or series of securities issued by the company proportionate to their holdings or proportionate to any cash distribution made to them by the company (subject to appropriate qualifications designed solely to avoid issuance of fractional securities); or (iii) in accordance with rules and regulations of the Commission made pursuant to subsection (b) of <uscode edition="2012" section="80a-12" title="15">section 80a–12 of this title</uscode>.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspension of right of redemption or postponement of date of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registered investment company shall suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after the tender of such security to the company or its agent designated for that purpose for redemption, except—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any period (A) during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed other than customary week-end and holiday closings or (B) during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which (A) disposal by the company of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or (B) it is not reasonably practicable for such company fairly to determine the value of its net assets; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for such other periods as the Commission may by order permit for the protection of security holders of the company.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall by rules and regulations determine the conditions under which (i) trading shall be deemed to be restricted and (ii) an emergency shall be deemed to exist within the meaning of this subsection.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Restrictions on transferability or negotiability of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registered open-end company shall restrict the transferability or negotiability of any security of which it is the issuer except in conformity with the statements with respect thereto contained in its registration statement nor in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe in the interests of the holders of all of the outstanding securities of such investment company.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Issuance of securities for services or property other than cash</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registered open-end company shall issue any of its securities (1) for services; or (2) for property other than cash or securities (including securities of which such registered company is the issuer), except as a dividend or distribution to its security holders or in connection with a reorganization.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Custody and sale of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No principal underwriter for or depositor of a registered unit investment trust shall sell, except by surrender to the trustee for redemption, any security of which such trust is the issuer (other than short-term paper), unless the trust indenture, agreement of custodianship, or other instrument pursuant to which such security is issued—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) designates one or more trustees or custodians, each of which is a bank, and provides that each such trustee or custodian shall have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus, and undivided profits of a specified minimum amount, which shall not be less than $500,000 (but may also provide, if such trustee or custodian publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, that for the purposes of this paragraph the aggregate capital, surplus, and undivided profits of such trustee or custodian shall be deemed to be its aggregate capital, surplus, and undivided profits as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published);</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides, in substance, (A) that during the life of the trust the trustee or custodian, if not otherwise remunerated, may charge against and collect from the income of the trust, and from the corpus thereof if no income is available, such fees for its services and such reimbursement for its expenses as are provided for in such instrument; (B) that no such charge or collection shall be made except for services theretofore performed or expenses theretofore incurred; (C) that no payment to the depositor of or a principal underwriter for such trust, or to any affiliated person or agent of such depositor or underwriter, shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense (except that provision may be made for the payment to any such person of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe as compensation for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services, of a character normally performed by the trustee or custodian itself); and (D) that the trustee or custodian shall have possession of all securities and other property in which the funds of the trust are invested, all funds held for such investment, all equalization, redemption, and other special funds of the trust, and all income upon, accretions to, and proceeds of such property and funds, and shall segregate and hold the same in trust (subject only to the charges and collections allowed under clauses (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph) until distribution thereof to the security holders of the trust;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides, in substance, that the trustee or custodian shall not resign until either (A) the trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds of the liquidation distributed to the security holders of the trust, or (B) a successor trustee or custodian, having the qualifications prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subsection, has been designated and has accepted such trusteeship or custodianship; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provides, in substance, (A) that a record will be kept by the depositor or an agent of the depositor of the name and address of, and the shares issued by the trust and held by, every holder of any security issued pursuant to such instrument, insofar as such information is known to the depositor or agent; and (B) that whenever a security is deposited with the trustee in substitution for any security in which such security holder has an undivided interest, the depositor or the agent of the depositor will, within five days after such substitution, either deliver or mail to such security holder a notice of substitution, including an identification of the securities eliminated and the securities substituted, and a specification of the shares of such security holder affected by the substitution.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bank or affiliated person of bank as trustee or custodian</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, after consultation with and taking into consideration the views of the Federal banking agencies (as defined in <uscode edition="2012" section="1813" title="12">section 1813 of title 12</uscode>), adopt rules and regulations, and issue orders, consistent with the protection of investors, prescribing the conditions under which a bank, or an affiliated person of a bank, either of which is an affiliated person of a principal underwriter for, or depositor of, a registered unit investment trust, may serve as trustee or custodian under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Substitution of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Binding contract or agreement embodying applicable provisions deemed to qualify non-complying instrument by which securities were issued</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that a trust indenture, agreement of custodianship, or other instrument pursuant to which securities of a registered unit investment trust are issued does not comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, such instrument will be deemed to meet such requirements if a written contract or agreement binding on the parties and embodying such requirements has been executed by the depositor on the one part and the trustee or custodian on the other part, and three copies of such contract or agreement have been filed with the Commission.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liquidation of unit investment trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that a unit investment trust is inactive and that its liquidation is in the interest of the security holders of such trust, the Commission may file a complaint seeking the liquidation of such trust in the district court of the United States in any district wherein any trustee of such trust resides or has its principal place of business. A copy of such complaint shall be served on every trustee of such trust, and notice of the proceeding shall be given such other interested persons in such manner and at such times as the court may direct. If the court determines that such liquidation is in the interest of the security holders of such trust, the court shall order such liquidation and, after payment of necessary expenses, the distribution of the proceeds to the security holders of the trust in such manner and on such terms as may to the court appear equitable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) complies with all other applicable provisions of this section, as if it were a trustee or custodian of the registered separate account;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f_2_B_ii"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) files with the insurance regulatory authority of the State which is the domiciliary State of the insurance company, an annual statement of its financial condition, which most recent statement indicates that the insurance company has a combined capital and surplus, if a stock company, or an unassigned surplus, if a mutual company, of not less than $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Commission, upon application or otherwise, that smaller companies are subjected to relatively higher operating costs and that in order to make due allowance therefor it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors that a provision or provisions of paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) of this section relative to sales load be relaxed in the case of certain registered investment companies issuing periodic payment plan certificates, or certain specified classes of such companies, the Commission is authorized by rules and regulations or order to grant any such company or class of companies appropriate qualified exemptions from the provisions of said paragraphs.</p>

The Commission may make rules and regulations applicable to such underwriters and depositors specifying such reserve requirements as it deems necessary or appropriate in order for such underwriters and depositors to carry out the obligations to refund sales charges required by this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any periodic payment plan (other than a plan under which the amount of sales load deducted from any payment thereon does not exceed 9 per centum of such payment), the custodian bank for such plan shall mail to each certificate holder, within sixty days after the issuance of the certificate, a statement of charges to be deducted from the projected payments on the certificate and a notice of his right of withdrawal as specified in this section. The Commission may make rules specifying the method, form, and contents of the notice required by this subsection. The certificate holder may within forty-five days of the mailing of the notice specified in this subsection surrender his certificate and receive in payment thereof, in cash, the sum of (1) the value of his account, and (2) an amount, from the underwriter or depositor, equal to the difference between the gross payments made and the net amount invested. The Commission may make rules and regulations applicable to underwriters and depositors of companies issuing any such certificate specifying such reserve requirements as it deems necessary or appropriate in order for such underwriters and depositors to carry out the obligations to refund sales charges required by this subsection.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Sale of certificates; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon making the election specified in subsection (g) of this section, it shall be unlawful for any such electing registered investment company issuing periodic payment plan certificates, or for any depositor of or underwriter for such company, to sell any such certificate, if—</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<a name="substructure-location_a"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Issuance or sale of certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company to issue or sell any face-amount certificate, or to collect or accept any payment on any such certificate issued by such company on or after the effective date of this subchapter, unless—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such company, if organized before March 15, 1940, was actively and continuously engaged in selling face-amount certificates on and before that date, and has outstanding capital stock worth upon a fair valuation of assets not less than $50,000; or if organized on or after March 15, 1940, has capital stock in an amount not less than $250,000 which has been bona fide subscribed and paid for in cash; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such company maintains at all times minimum certificate reserves on all its outstanding face-amount certificates in an aggregate amount calculated and adjusted as follows:</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the reserves for each certificate of the installment type shall be based on assumed annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly reserve payments according to the manner in which gross payments for any certificate year are made by the holder, which reserve payments shall be sufficient in amount, as and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually, to provide the minimum maturity or face amount of the certificate when due. Such reserve payments may be graduated according to certificate years so that the reserve payment or payments for the first certificate year shall amount to at least 50 per centum of the required gross annual payment for such year and the reserve payment or payments for each of the second to fifth certificate years inclusive shall amount to at least 93 per centum of each such year's required gross annual payment and for the sixth and each subsequent certificate year the reserve payment or payments shall amount to at least 96 per centum of each such year's required gross annual payment: <i>Provided</i>, That such aggregate reserve payments shall amount to at least 93 per centum of the aggregate gross annual payments required to be made by the holder to obtain the maturity of the certificate. The company may at its option take as loading from the gross payment or payments for a certificate year, as and when made by the certificate holder, an amount or amounts equal in the aggregate for such year to not more than the excess, if any, of the gross payment or payments required to be made by the holder for such year, over and above the percentage of the gross annual payment required herein for such year for reserve purposes. Such loading may be taken by the company prior to or after the setting up of the reserve payment or payments for such year and the reserve payment or payments for such year may be graduated and adjusted to correspond with the amount of the gross payment or payments made by the certificate holder for such year less the loading so taken;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the foregoing minimum percentages of the gross annual payments required under the provisions of such certificate should produce reserve payments larger than are necessary at 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually to provide the minimum maturity or face amount of the certificate when due, the reserve shall be based upon reserve payments accumulated as provided under preceding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph except that in lieu of the 3½ per centum rate specified therein, such rate shall be lowered to the minimum rate, expressed in multiples of one-eighth of 1 per centum, which will accumulate such reserve payments to the maturity value when due;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_C"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the actual annual gross payment to be made by the certificate holder on any certificate issued prior to or after the effective date of this chapter is less than the amount of any assumed reserve payment or payments for a certificate year, such company shall maintain as a part of such minimum certificate reserves a deficiency reserve equal to the total present value of future deficiencies in the gross payments, calculated at a rate not to exceed 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_D"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) for each certificate of the installment type the amount of the reserve shall at any time be at least equal to (1) the then amount of the reserve payments set up under subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this paragraph; (2) the accumulations on such reserve payments as computed under subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this paragraph; (3) the amount of any deficiency reserve required under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph; and (4) such amount as shall have been credited to the account of each certificate holder in the form of any credit, or any dividend, or any interest in addition to the minimum maturity amount specified in such certificate, plus any accumulations on any amount or amounts so credited, at a rate not exceeding 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_E"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) for each certificate which is fully paid, including any fully paid obligations resulting from or effected upon the maturity of the previously issued certificate, and for each paid-up certificate issued as provided in subsection (f) of this section prior to maturity, the amount of the reserve shall at any time be at least equal to (1) such amount as and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually, will provide the amount or amounts payable when due and (2) such amount as shall have been credited to the account of each such certificate holder in the form of any credit, or any dividend, or any interest in addition to the minimum maturity amount specified in the certificate, plus any accumulations on any amount or amounts so credited, at a rate not exceeding 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_F"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for each certificate of the installment type under which gross payments have been made by or credited to the holder thereof covering a payment period or periods or any part thereof beyond the then current payment period as defined by the terms of such certificate, and for which period or periods no reserve has been set up under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, an advance payment reserve shall be set up and maintained in the amount of the present value of any such unapplied advance gross payments, computed at a rate not to exceed 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2_G"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) such appropriate contingency reserves for death and disability benefits and for reinstatement rights on any such certificate providing for such benefits or rights as the Commission shall prescribe by rule, regulation, or order based upon the experience of face-amount companies in relation to such contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">At no time shall the aggregate certificate reserves herein required by subparagraphs (A) to (F) of this paragraph, be less than the aggregate surrender values and other amounts to which all certificate holders may be then entitled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this subsection, no certificate of the installment type shall be deemed to be outstanding if before a surrender value has been attained the holder thereof has been in continuous default in making his payments thereon for a period of one year.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Asset requirements prior to sale of certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company to issue or sell any face-amount certificate, or to collect or accept any payment on any such certificate issued by such company on or after the effective date of this subchapter, unless such company has, in cash or qualified investments, assets having a value not less than the aggregate amount of the capital stock requirement and certificate reserves as computed under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. As used in this subsection, "qualified investments" means investments of a kind which life-insurance companies are permitted to invest in or hold under the provisions of the Code of the District of Columbia as heretofore or hereafter amended, and such other investments as the Commission shall by rule, regulation, or order authorize as qualified investments. Such investments shall be valued in accordance with the provisions of said Code where such provisions are applicable. Investments to which such provisions do not apply shall be valued in accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders as the Commission shall prescribe for the protection of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certificate reserve requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall by rule, regulation, or order, in the public interest or for the protection of investors, require a registered face-amount certificate company to deposit and maintain, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe and as are appropriate for the protection of investors, with one or more institutions having the qualifications required by paragraph (1) of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2012" section="80a-26" title="15">section 80a–26(a) of this title</uscode> for a trustee of a unit investment trust, all or any part of the investments maintained by such company as certificate reserve requirements under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section: <i>Provided, however</i>, That where qualified investments are maintained on deposit by such company in respect of its liabilities under certificates issued to or held by residents of any State as required by the statute of such State or by any order, regulation, or requirement of such State or any official or agency thereof, the amount so on deposit, but not to exceed the amount of reserves required by subsection (a) of this section for the certificates so issued or held, shall be deducted from the amount of qualified investments that may be required to be deposited hereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Assets which are qualified investments under subsection (b) of this section and which are deposited under or as permitted by this subsection, may be used and shall be considered as a part of the assets required to be maintained under the provisions of said subsection (b).</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisions required in certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company to issue or sell any face-amount certificate, or to collect or accept any payment on any such certificate issued by such company on or after the effective date of this subchapter, unless such certificate contains a provision or provisions to the effect—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that, in respect of any certificate of the installment type, during the first certificate year the holder of the certificate, upon surrender thereof, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash not less than the reserve payments as specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section and at the end of such certificate year, a value payable in cash at least equal to 50 per centum of the amount of the gross annual payment required thereby for such year;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that, in respect of any certificate of the installment type, at any time after the expiration of the first certificate year and prior to maturity, the holder of the certificate, upon surrender thereof, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash not less than the then amount of the reserve for such certificate required by numbered items (1) and (2) of subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, less a surrender charge that shall not exceed 2 per centum of the face or maturity amount of the certificate, or 15 per centum of the amount of such reserve, whichever is the lesser, but in no event shall such value be less than 50 per centum of the amount of such reserve. The amount of the surrender value for the end of each certificate year shall be set out in the certificate;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that, in respect of any certificate of the installment type, the holder of the certificate, upon surrender thereof for cash or upon receipt of a paid-up certificate as provided in subsection (f) of this section, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash equal to the then amount of any advance payment reserve under such certificate required by subparagraph (F) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section in addition to any other amounts due the holder hereunder;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_4"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that at any time prior to maturity, in respect of any certificate which is fully paid, the holder of the certificate, upon surrender thereof, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash not less than the then amount of the reserve for such certificate required by item (1) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, less a surrender charge that shall not exceed 2 per centum of the face or maturity amount of the certificate, or 15 per centum of the amount of such reserve, whichever is the lesser: <i>Provided, however</i>, That such surrender charge shall not apply as to any obligations of a fully paid type resulting from the maturity of a previously issued certificate. The amount of the surrender value for the end of each certificate year shall be set out in the certificate;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that in respect of any certificate, the holder of the certificate, upon maturity, upon surrender thereof for cash or upon receipt of a paid-up certificate as provided in subsection (f) of this section, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash equal to the then amount of the reserve, if any, for such certificate required by item (4) of subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section or item (2) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of said subsection (a) in addition to any other amounts due the holder hereunder.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">The term "certificate year" as used in this section in respect of any certificate of the installment type means a period or periods for which one year's payment or payments as provided by the certificate have been made thereon by the holder and the certificate maintained in force by such payments for the time for which the same have been made, and in respect of any certificate which is fully paid or paid-up means any year ending on the anniversary of the date of issuance of the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any certificate may provide for loans or advances by the company to the certificate holder on the security of such certificate upon terms prescribed therein but at an interest rate not exceeding 6 per centum per annum. The amount of the required reserves, deposits, and the surrender values thereof available to the holder may be adjusted to take into account any unpaid balance on such loans or advances and interest thereon, for the purposes of this subsection and subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any certificate may provide that the company at its option may, prior to the maturity thereof, defer any payment or payments to the certificate holder to which he may be entitled under this subsection, for a period of not more than thirty days: <i>Provided</i>, That in the event such option is exercised by the company, interest shall accrue on any payment or payments due to the holder, for the period of such deferment at a rate equal to that used in accumulating the reserves for such certificate: <i>And provided further</i>, That the Commission may, by rules and regulations or orders in the public interest or for the protection of investors, make provision for any other deferment upon such terms and conditions as it shall prescribe.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability of holder to legal action for unpaid amount of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company to issue or sell any face-amount certificate, or to collect or accept any payment on any such certificate issued by such company on or after the effective date of this subchapter, which certificate makes the holder liable to any legal action or proceeding for any unpaid amount on such certificate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Optional right to paid up certificate in lieu of cash surrender value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company to issue or sell any face-amount certificate, or to collect or accept any payment on any such certificate issued by such company on or after the effective date of this subchapter, (1) unless such face-amount certificate contains a provision or provisions to the effect that the holder shall have an optional right to receive a paid-up certificate in lieu of the then attained cash surrender value provided therein and in the amount of such value plus accumulations thereon at a rate to be specified in the paid-up certificate equal to that used in computing the reserve on the original certificate under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, such paid-up certificate to become due and payable at the end of a period equal to the balance of the term of such original certificate before maturity; and during the period prior to maturity such paid-up certificate shall have a cash value upon surrender thereof equal to the then amount of the reserve therefor; and (2) unless such face-amount certificate contains a further provision or provisions to the effect that if the holder be in continuous default in his payments on such certificate for a period of six months without having exercised his option to receive a paid-up certificate, as herein provided, the company at the expiration of such six months shall pay the surrender value in cash if such value is less than $100 or if such value is $100 or more shall issue such paid-up certificate to such holder and such payment or issuance, plus the payment of all other amounts to which he may be then entitled under the original certificate, shall operate to cancel his original certificate: <i>Provided</i>, That in lieu of the issuance of a new paid-up certificate the original certificate may be converted into a paid-up certificate with the same effect; and (3) unless, where such certificate provides, in the event of default, for the deferment of payments thereon by the holder or of the due dates of such payments or of the maturity date of the certificate, it shall also provide in effect for the right of reinstatement by the holder of the certificate after default and for an option in the holder, at the time of reinstatement, to make up the payment or payments for the default period next preceding such reinstatement with interest thereon not exceeding 6 per centum per annum, with the same effect as if no such default in making such payments had occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The term "default" as used in this subsection shall, without restricting its usual meaning, include a failure to make a payment or payments as and when provided by the certificate.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Application of section to company issuing certificates only to holders of previously issued certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to a face-amount certificate company which on or before the effective date of this chapter has discontinued the offering of face-amount certificates to the public and issues face-amount certificates only to the holders of certificates previously issued pursuant to an obligation expressed or implied in such certificates.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Declaration or payment of dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered face-amount certificate company which does not maintain the minimum certificate reserve on all its outstanding face-amount certificates issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, in an aggregate amount calculated and adjusted as provided in this section to declare or pay any dividends on the shares of such company for or during any calendar year which shall exceed one-third of the net earnings for the next preceding calendar year or which shall exceed 10 per centum of the aggregate net earnings for the next preceding five calendar years, whichever is the lesser amount, or any dividend which shall have been forbidden by the Commission pursuant to the provision of the next sentence of this paragraph. At least thirty days before such company shall declare, pay, or distribute any dividend, it shall give the Commission written notice of its intention to declare, pay, or distribute the same; and if at any time it shall appear to the Commission that the declaration, payment or distribution of any dividend for or during any calendar year might impair the financial integrity of such company or its ability to meet its liabilities under its outstanding face-amount certificates, it may by order forbid the declaration, distribution, or payment of any such dividend.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Application of section to certificates issued prior to effective date of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply to all face-amount certificates issued prior to the effective date of this subsection; to the collection or acceptance of any payment on such certificates; to the issuance of face-amount certificates to the holders of such certificates pursuant to an obligation expressed or implied in such certificates; to the provisions of such certificates; to the minimum certificate reserves and deposits maintained with respect thereto; and to the assets that the issuer of such certificate was and is required to have with respect to such certificates. With respect to all face-amount certificates issued after the effective date of this subsection, the provisions of this section shall apply except as hereinafter provided.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, the reserves for each certificate of the installment type shall be based on assumed annual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly reserve payments according to the manner in which gross payments for any certificate year are made by the holder, which reserve payments shall be sufficient in amount, as and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3½ per centum per annum compounded annually, to provide the minimum maturity or face amount of the certificate when due. Such reserve payments may be graduated according to certificate years so that the reserve payment or payments for the first three certificate years shall amount to at least 80 per centum of the required gross annual payment for such years; the reserve payment or payments for the fourth certificate year shall amount to at least 90 per centum of such year's required gross annual payment; the reserve payment or payments for the fifth certificate year shall amount to at least 93 per centum of such year's gross annual payment; and for the sixth and each subsequent certificate year the reserve payment or payments shall amount to at least 96 per centum of each such year's required gross annual payment: <i>Provided</i>, That such aggregate reserve payments shall amount to at least 93 per centum of the aggregate gross annual payments required to be made by the holder to obtain the maturity of the certificate.

Such loading may be taken by the company prior to or after the setting up of the reserve payment or payments for such year and the reserve payment or payments for such year may be graduated and adjusted to correspond with the amount of the gross payment or payments made by the certificate holder for such year less the loading so taken.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such accountant shall have been selected at a meeting held within thirty days before or after the beginning of the fiscal year or before the annual meeting of stockholders in that year by the vote, cast in person, of a majority of those members of the board of directors who are not interested persons of such registered company;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>

<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>

In the case of a common-law trust of the character described in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="80a-16" title="15">section 80a–16(c) of this title</uscode>, no ratification of the employment of such accountant shall be required but such employment may be terminated and such accountant removed by action of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest in such trust in the same manner as is provided in <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2012" section="80a-16" title="15">section 80a–16(c) of this title</uscode> in respect of the removal of a trustee, and all the provisions therein contained as to the calling of a meeting shall be applicable. In the event of such termination and removal, the vacancy so occurring may be filled by action of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of beneficial interest either at the meeting, if any, at which such termination and removal occurs, or by instruments in writing filed with the custodian, or if not so filed within a reasonable time then at a subsequent meeting which shall be called by the trustees for the purpose. The provisions of paragraph (42) of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2012" section="80a-2" title="15">section 80a–2(a) of this title</uscode> as to a majority shall be applicable to the vote cast at any meeting of the shareholders of such a trust held pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction of courts of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, and other records. And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who without just cause shall fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records, if in his or its power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.</p>

Upon a showing that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction or decree or restraining order shall be granted without bond. In any proceeding under this subsection to enforce compliance with <uscode edition="2012" section="80a-7" title="15">section 80a–7 of this title</uscode>, the court as a court of equity may, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the investment company or companies involved and the books, records, and assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction to appoint a trustee, who with the approval of the court shall have power to dispose of any or all of such assets, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to any member of the Commission or any officer thereof designated by the Commission for that purpose, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in <uscode edition="2012" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>.

If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order.

<p class="statutory-body">No investment adviser registered or required to be registered with the Commission shall enter into, extend, or renew any investment advisory contract, or in any way perform any investment advisory contract entered into, extended, or renewed on or after November 1, 1940, if such contract—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) fails to provide, in substance, that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the contract; or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_a_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) fails to provide, in substance, that the investment adviser, if a partnership, will notify the other party to the contract of any change in the membership of such partnership within a reasonable time after such change.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compensation prohibition inapplicable to certain compensation computations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall not—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be construed to prohibit an investment advisory contract which provides for compensation based upon the total value of a fund averaged over a definite period, or as of definite dates, or taken as of a definite date;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) apply to an investment advisory contract with—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an investment company registered under subchapter I of this chapter, or</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_2_B"></a>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the contract provides for compensation based on the asset value of the company or fund under management averaged over a specified period and increasing and decreasing proportionately with the investment performance of the company or fund over a specified period in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices or such other measure of investment performance as the Commission by rule, regulation, or order may specify;</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b_3"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) apply with respect to any investment advisory contract between an investment adviser and a business development company, as defined in this subchapter, if (A) the compensation provided for in such contract does not exceed 20 per centum of the realized capital gains upon the funds of the business development company over a specified period or as of definite dates, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, and the condition of <uscode detail="(a)(3)(B)(iii)" edition="2012" section="80a-60" title="15">section 80a–60(a)(3)(B)(iii) of this title</uscode> is satisfied, and (B) the business development company does not have outstanding any option, warrant, or right issued pursuant to <uscode detail="(a)(3)(B)" edition="2012" section="80a-60" title="15">section 80a–60(a)(3)(B) of this title</uscode> and does not have a profit-sharing plan described in <uscode detail="(n)" edition="2012" section="80a-56" title="15">section 80a–56(n) of this title</uscode>;</p>

<a name="substructure-location_b_5"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) apply to an investment advisory contract with a person who is not a resident of the United States.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Measurement of changes in compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section, the point from which increases and decreases in compensation are measured shall be the fee which is paid or earned when the investment performance of such company or fund is equivalent to that of the index or other measure of performance, and an index of securities prices shall be deemed appropriate unless the Commission by order shall determine otherwise.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) "Investment advisory contract" defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of this section, "investment advisory contract" means any contract or agreement whereby a person agrees to act as investment adviser to or to manage any investment or trading account of another person other than an investment company registered under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exempt persons and transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rule or regulation, upon its own motion, or by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or transaction, or any class or classes of persons or transactions, from subsection (a)(1) of this section, if and to the extent that the exemption relates to an investment advisory contract with any person that the Commission determines does not need the protections of subsection (a)(1) of this section, on the basis of such factors as financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge of and experience in financial matters, amount of assets under management, relationship with a registered investment adviser, and such other factors as the Commission determines are consistent with this section. With respect to any factor used in any rule or regulation by the Commission in making a determination under this subsection, if the Commission uses a dollar amount test in connection with such factor, such as a net asset threshold, the Commission shall, by order, not later than 1 year after July 21, 2010, and every 5 years thereafter, adjust for the effects of inflation on such test. Any such adjustment that is not a multiple of $100,000 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100,000.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority to restrict mandatory pre-dispute arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, by rule, may prohibit, or impose conditions or limitations on the use of, agreements that require customers or clients of any investment adviser to arbitrate any future dispute between them arising under the Federal securities laws, the rules and regulations thereunder, or the rules of a self-regulatory organization if it finds that such prohibition, imposition of conditions, or limitations are in the public interest and for the protection of investors.</p>

And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who without just cause shall fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records, if in his or its power so to do, in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both.</p>

For the purposes of its rules or regulations the Commission may classify persons and matters within its jurisdiction and prescribe different requirements for different classes of persons or matters.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_b"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effective date of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of <uscode chapter="15" edition="2012" title="44">chapter 15 of title 44</uscode> and regulations prescribed under the authority thereof, the rules and regulations of the Commission under this subchapter, and amendments thereof, shall be effective upon publication in the manner which the Commission shall prescribe, or upon such later date as may be provided in such rules and regulations.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_c"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Orders of Commission after notice and hearing; type of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Orders of the Commission under this subchapter shall be issued only after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing. Notice to the parties to a proceeding before the Commission shall be given by personal service upon each party or by registered mail or certified mail or confirmed telegraphic notice to the party's last known business address. Notice to interested persons, if any, other than parties may be given in the same manner or by publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_d"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Good faith compliance with rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this subchapter imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, notwithstanding that such rule, regulation, or order may, after such act or omission, be amended or rescinded or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_e"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disclosure rules on private funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall, after consultation with the Council but not later than 12 months after July 21, 2010, jointly promulgate rules to establish the form and content of the reports required to be filed with the Commission under subsection <sup><a href="#80b-11_1_target" name="80b-11_1">1</a></sup> 80b–4(b) of this title and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by investment advisers that are registered both under this subchapter and the Commodity Exchange Act [<uscode edition="2012" section="1" title="7">7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.</uscode>].</p>

<a name="substructure-location_g_1"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice. In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer. Such rules shall provide that such standard of conduct shall be no less stringent than the standard applicable to investment advisers under section 80b–6(1) and (2) of this title when providing personalized investment advice about securities, except the Commission shall not ascribe a meaning to the term "customer" that would include an investor in a private fund managed by an investment adviser, where such private fund has entered into an advisory contract with such adviser. The receipt of compensation based on commission or fees shall not, in and of itself, be considered a violation of such standard applied to a broker, dealer, or investment adviser.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2"></a>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retail customer defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term "retail customer" means a natural person, or the legal representative of such natural person, who—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2_A"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) receives personalized investment advice about securities from a broker, dealer, or investment adviser; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_g_2_B"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) uses such advice primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Other matters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any material conflicts of interest; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_h_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors.</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i"></a>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Harmonization of enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser shall include—</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_1"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to such violations provided under this subchapter; and</p>
<a name="substructure-location_i_2"></a>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [<uscode edition="2012" section="78a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.</uscode>], including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations, and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser under this subchapter to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and sanctions violators of the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [<uscode edition="2012" section="78a" title="15">15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.</uscode>].</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition; jurisdiction; findings of Commission; additional evidence; finality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission under this subchapter may obtain a review of such order in the United States court of appeals within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal office or place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by the Commission for that purpose, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in <uscode edition="2012" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Commission shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in <uscode edition="2012" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The commencement of proceedings under subsection (a) of this section shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission's order.</p>
