<h4 class="note-head">Section 1. Authority To Delegate</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) In addition to its existing authority, the Federal Trade Commission, hereinafter referred to as the “Commission”, shall have the authority to delegate, by published order or rule, any of its functions to a division of the Commission, an individual Commissioner, a hearing examiner, or an employee or employee board, including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter; <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing herein contained shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (<statuteatlarge page="241" volume="60">60 Stat. 241</statuteatlarge>), as amended [see <uscode edition="2001" section="556" title="5">5 U.S.C. 556</uscode>].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) With respect to the delegation of any of its functions, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall retain a discretionary right to review the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing examiner, employee or employee board, upon its own initiative or upon petition of a party to or an intervenor in such action, within such time and in such manner as the Commission shall by rule prescribe: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the vote of a majority of the Commission less one member thereof shall be sufficient to bring any such action before the Commission for review.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Should the right to exercise such discretionary review be declined, or should no such review be sought within the time stated in the rules promulgated by the Commission, then the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing examiner, employee or employee board, shall, for all purposes, including appeal or review thereof, be deemed to be the action of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Transfer of Functions to the Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the functions transferred by the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 (<statuteatlarge page="1264" volume="64">64 Stat. 1264</statuteatlarge>) [set out as a note under this section], there are hereby transferred from the Commission to the Chairman of the Commission the functions of the Commission with respect to the assignment of Commission personnel, including Commissioners, to perform such functions as may have been delegated by the Commission to Commission personnel, including Commissioners, pursuant to section 1 of this reorganization plan.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization in the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961 follows upon my message of April 13, 1961, to the Congress of the United States. It is believed that the taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan will provide for greater efficiency in the dispatch of the business of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan provides for greater flexibility in the handling of the business before the Commission, permitting its disposition at different levels so as better to promote its efficient dispatch. Thus matters both of an adjudicatory and regulatory nature may, depending upon their importance and their complexity, be finally consummated by divisions of the Commission, individual Commissioners, hearing examiners, and, subject to the provisions of section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (<statuteatlarge page="241" volume="60">60 Stat. 241</statuteatlarge>), by other employees. This will relieve the Commissioners from the necessity of dealing with many matters of lesser importance and thus conserve their time for the consideration of major matters of policy and planning. There is, however, reserved to the Commission as a whole the right to review any such decision, report or certification either upon its own initiative or upon the petition of a party or intervenor demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Commission the desirability of having the matter reviewed at the top level.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision is also made, in order to maintain the fundamental bipartisan concept explicit in the basic statute creating the Commission, for mandatory review of any such decision, report or certification upon the vote of a majority of the Commission less one member.</p>
<p class="note-body">Inasmuch as the assignment of delegated functions in particular cases and with reference to particular problems to divisions of the Commission, to Commissioners, to hearing examiners, to employees and boards of employees must require continuous and flexible handling, depending both upon the amount and nature of the business, that function is placed in the Chairman by section 2 of the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">By providing sound organizational arrangements, the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan will make possible more economical and expeditious administration of the affected functions. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the reorganization plan transmitted herewith is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of unlawfulness; power to prohibit unfair practices; inapplicability to foreign trade</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, savings and loan institutions described in <uscode detail="(f)(3)" edition="2001" section="57a" title="15">section 57a(f)(3) of this title</uscode>, Federal credit unions described in <uscode detail="(f)(4)" edition="2001" section="57a" title="15">section 57a(f)(4) of this title</uscode>, common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, air carriers and foreign air carriers subject to part A of subtitle VII of title 49, and persons, partnerships, or corporations insofar as they are subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended [<uscode edition="2001" section="181" title="7">7 U.S.C. 181 et seq.</uscode>], except as provided in section 406(b) of said Act [<uscode detail="(b)" edition="2001" section="227" title="7">7 U.S.C. 227(b)</uscode>], from using unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall not apply to unfair methods of competition involving commerce with foreign nations (other than import commerce) unless—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such methods of competition have a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) on commerce which is not commerce with foreign nations, or on import commerce with foreign nations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) on export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such commerce in the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of this subsection, other than this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">If this subsection applies to such methods of competition only because of the operation of subparagraph (A)(ii), this subsection shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proceeding by Commission; modifying and setting aside orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person, partnership, or corporation so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the Commission requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. Any person, partnership, or corporation may make application, and upon good cause shown may be allowed by the Commission to intervene and appear in said proceeding by counsel or in person. The testimony in any such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Commission. If upon such hearing the Commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition or the act or practice in question is prohibited by this subchapter, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts and shall issue and cause to be served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from using such method of competition or such act or practice. Until the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time, or, if a petition for review has been filed within such time then until the record in the proceeding has been filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided, the Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any report or any order made or issued by it under this section. After the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time, the Commission may at any time, after notice and opportunity for hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part any report or order made or issued by it under this section, whenever in the opinion of the Commission conditions of fact or of law have so changed as to require such action or if the public interest shall so require, except that (1) the said person, partnership, or corporation may, within sixty days after service upon him or it of said report or order entered after such a reopening, obtain a review thereof in the appropriate court of appeals of the United States, in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this <!-- PDFPage:43 -->section; and (2) in the case of an order, the Commission shall reopen any such order to consider whether such order (including any affirmative relief provision contained in such order) should be altered, modified, or set aside, in whole or in part, if the person, partnership, or corporation involved files a request with the Commission which makes a satisfactory showing that changed conditions of law or fact require such order to be altered, modified, or set aside, in whole or in part. The Commission shall determine whether to alter, modify, or set aside any order of the Commission in response to a request made by a person, partnership, or corporation under paragraph <sup><a href="#45_1_target" name="45_1">1</a></sup> (2) not later than 120 days after the date of the filing of such request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of order; rehearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, partnership, or corporation required by an order of the Commission to cease and desist from using any method of competition or act or practice may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the United States, within any circuit where the method of competition or the act or practice in question was used or where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or carries on business, by filing in the court, within sixty days from the date of the service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in <uscode edition="2001" section="2112" title="28">section 2112 of title 28</uscode>. Upon such filing of the petition the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein concurrently with the Commission until the filing of the record and shall have power to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the Commission, and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed and to issue such writs as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or are necessary in its judgement to prevent injury to the public or to competitors pendente lite. The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. To the extent that the order of the Commission is affirmed, the court shall thereupon issue its own order commanding obedience to the terms of such order of the Commission. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order, with the return of such additional evidence. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, as provided in <uscode edition="2001" section="1254" title="28">section 1254 of title 28</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the court of appeals of the United States to affirm, enforce, modify, or set aside orders of the Commission shall be exclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exemption from liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No order of the Commission or judgement of court to enforce the same shall in anywise relieve or absolve any person, partnership, or corporation from any liability under the Antitrust Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Service of complaints, orders and other processes; return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Complaints, orders, and other processes of the Commission under this section may be served by anyone duly authorized by the Commission, either (a) by delivering a copy thereof to the person to be served, or to a member of the partnership to be served, or the president, secretary, or other executive officer or a director of the corporation to be served; or (b) by leaving a copy thereof at the residence or the principal office or place of business of such person, partnership, or corporation; or (c) by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail or by certified mail addressed to such person, partnership, or corporation at his or its residence or principal office or place of business. The verified return by the person so serving said complaint, order, or other process setting forth the manner of said service shall be proof of the same, and the return post office receipt for said complaint, order, or other process mailed by registered mail or by certified mail as aforesaid shall be proof of the service of the same.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Finality of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order of the Commission to cease and desist shall become final—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time; but the Commission may thereafter modify or set aside its order to the extent provided in the last sentence of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except as to any order provision subject to paragraph (4), upon the sixtieth day after such order is served, if a petition for review has been duly filed; except that any such order may be stayed, in whole or in part and subject to such conditions as may be appropriate, by—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Commission;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates an order of the Commission after it has become final, and while such order is in effect, shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation, which shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the Attorney General of the United States. Each separate violation of such an order shall be a separate offense, except that in a case of a violation through continuing failure to obey or neglect to obey a final order of the Commission, each day of continuance of such failure or neglect shall be deemed a separate offense. In such actions, the United States district courts are empowered to grant mandatory injunctions and such other and further equitable relief as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission.</p>

In such action, such person, partnership, or corporation shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section that any act or practice is unfair or deceptive, and issues a final cease and desist order, other than a consent order, with respect to such act or practice, then the Commission may commence a civil action to obtain a civil penalty in a district court <!-- PDFPage:45 -->of the United States against any person, partnership, or corporation which engages in such act or practice—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after such cease and desist order becomes final (whether or not such person, partnership, or corporation was subject to such cease and desist order), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with actual knowledge that such act or practice is unfair or deceptive and is unlawful under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In such action, such person, partnership, or corporation shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a violation through continuing failure to comply with a rule or with subsection (a)(1) of this section, each day of continuance of such failure shall be treated as a separate violation, for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B). In determining the amount of such a civil penalty, the court shall take into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the cease and desist order establishing that the act or practice is unfair or deceptive was not issued against the defendant in a civil penalty action under paragraph (1)(B) the issues of fact in such action against such defendant shall be tried de novo. Upon request of any party to such an action against such defendant, the court shall also review the determination of law made by the Commission in the proceeding under subsection (b) of this section that the act or practice which was the subject of such proceeding constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may compromise or settle any action for a civil penalty if such compromise or settlement is accompanied by a public statement of its reasons and is approved by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Standard of proof; public policy consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have no authority under this section or <uscode edition="2001" section="57a" title="15">section 57a of this title</uscode> to declare unlawful an act or practice on the grounds that such act or practice is unfair unless the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, the Commission may consider established public policies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose may bring suit in a district court of the United States or in the United States court of any Territory, to enjoin the dissemination or the causing of the dissemination of such advertisement.

Any suit may be brought where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or transacts business, or wherever venue is proper under <uscode edition="2001" section="1391" title="28">section 1391 of title 28</uscode>. In addition, the court may, if the court determines that the interests of justice require that any other person, partnership, or corporation should be a party in such suit, cause such other person, partnership, or corporation to be added as a party without regard to whether venue is otherwise proper in the district in which the suit is brought. In any suit under this section, process may be served on any person, partnership, or corporation wherever it may be found.</p>

Any suit may be brought where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or transacts business, or wherever venue is proper under <uscode edition="2001" section="1391" title="28">section 1391 of title 28</uscode>.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such delay would be due to the method by which the manufacture and distribution of such publication is customarily conducted by the publisher in accordance with sound business practice, and not to any method or device adopted for the evasion of this section or to prevent or delay the issuance of an injunction or restraining order with respect to such false advertisement or any other advertisement,</p>

No advertisement of a drug shall be deemed to be false if it is disseminated only to members of the medical profession, contains no false representation of a material fact, and includes, or is accompanied in each instance by truthful disclosure of, the formula showing quantitatively each ingredient of such drug.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) When any person who is a member of a group with respect to which the Commission has made a determination under subparagraph (A) is unable to agree upon group representation with the other members of the group, then such person shall not be denied under the authority of subparagraph (A) the opportunity to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting his particular interests if (i) he satisfies the Commission that he has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon group representation with the other members of the group and (ii) the Commission determines that there are substantial and relevant issues which are not adequately presented by the group representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A verbatim transcript shall be taken of any oral presentation, and cross-examination, in an informal hearing to which this subsection applies. Such transcript shall be available to the public.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The term “Commission” as used in this subsection and subsections (b) and (c) of this section includes any person authorized to act in behalf of the Commission in any part of the rulemaking proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section shall be prescribed, and subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed under such subsection. An exemption under subsection (g) of this section shall not be treated as an amendment or repeal of a rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When any rule under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section takes effect a subsequent violation thereof shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of <uscode detail="(a)(1)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(a)(1) of this title</uscode>, unless the Commission otherwise expressly provides in such rule.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Suits by Commission against persons, partnerships, or corporations; jurisdiction; relief for dishonest or fraudulent acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any person, partnership, or corporation violates any rule under this subchapter respecting unfair or deceptive acts or practices (other than an interpretive rule, or a rule violation of which the Commission has provided is not an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(a) of this title</uscode>), then the Commission may commence a civil action against such person, partnership, or corporation for relief under subsection (b) of this section in a United States district court or in any court of competent jurisdiction of a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any person, partnership, or corporation engages in any unfair or deceptive act or practice (within the meaning of <uscode detail="(a)(1)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(a)(1) of this title</uscode>) with respect to which the Commission has issued a final cease and desist order which is applicable to such person, partnership, or corporation, then the Commission may commence a civil action against such person, partnership, or corporation in a United States district court or in any court of competent jurisdiction of a State. If the Commission satisfies the court that the act or practice to which the cease and desist order relates is one which a reasonable man would have known under the circumstances was dishonest or fraudulent, the court may grant relief under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nature of relief available</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court in an action under subsection (a) of this section shall have jurisdiction to grant such relief as the court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers or other persons, partnerships, and corporations resulting from the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice, as the case may be. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to, rescission or reformation of contracts, the refund of money or return of property, the payment of damages, and public notification respecting the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice, as the case may be; except that nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize the imposition of any exemplary or punitive damages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conclusiveness of findings of Commission in cease and desist proceedings; notice of judicial proceedings to injured persons, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If (A) a cease and desist order issued under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(b) of this title</uscode> has become final under <uscode detail="(g)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(g) of this title</uscode> with respect to any person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or unfair or deceptive act or practice, and (B) an action under this section is brought with respect to such person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or act or practice, then the findings of the Commission as to the material facts in the proceeding under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(b) of this title</uscode> with respect to such person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or act or practice, shall be conclusive unless (i) the terms of such cease and desist order expressly provide that the Commission's findings shall not be conclusive, or (ii) the order became final by reason of <uscode detail="(g)(1)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(g)(1) of this title</uscode>, in which case such finding shall be conclusive if supported by evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall cause notice of an action under this section to be given in a manner which is reasonably calculated, under all of the circumstances, to apprise the persons, partnerships, and corporations allegedly injured by the defendant's rule violation or act or practice of the pendency of such action. Such notice may, in the discretion of the court, be given by publication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time for bringing of actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action may be brought by the Commission under this section more than 3 years after the rule violation to which an action under subsection (a)(1) of this section relates, or the unfair or deceptive act or practice to which an action under subsection (a)(2) of this section relates; except that if a cease and desist order with respect to any person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or unfair or deceptive act or practice has become final and such order was issued in a proceeding under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2001" section="45" title="15">section 45(b) of this title</uscode> which was commenced not later than 3 years after the rule violation or act or practice occurred, a civil action may be commenced under this section against such person, partnership, or corporation at any time before the expiration of one year after such order becomes final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of additional Federal or State remedies; other authority of Commission unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Remedies provided in this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy or right of action provided by State or Federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “Federal agency” has the meaning given it in section 552(e) <sup><a href="#57b-2_1_target" name="57b-2_1">1</a></sup> of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures respecting documents, tangible things, or transcripts of oral testimony received pursuant to compulsory process or investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any document, tangible thing, or transcript of oral testimony received by the Commission pursuant to compulsory process in an investigation, a purpose of which is to determine whether any person may have violated any provision of the laws administered by the Commission, the procedures established in paragraph (2) through paragraph (7) shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission shall designate a duly authorized agent to serve as custodian of documentary material, tangible things, or written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony, and such additional duly authorized agents as the Commission shall determine from time to time to be necessary to serve as deputies to the custodian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person upon whom any demand for the production of documentary material has been duly served shall make such material available for inspection and copying or reproduction to the custodian designated in such demand at the principal place of business of such person (or at such other place as such custodian and such person thereafter may agree or prescribe in writing <!-- PDFPage:68 -->or as the court may direct pursuant to section 57b–1(h) of this title) on the return date specified in such demand (or on such later date as such custodian may prescribe in writing). Such person may upon written agreement between such person and the custodian substitute copies for originals of all or any part of such material.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The custodian to whom any documentary material, tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony are delivered shall take physical possession of such material, reports or answers, and transcripts, and shall be responsible for the use made of such material, reports or answers, and transcripts, and for the return of material, pursuant to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The custodian may prepare such copies of the documentary material, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony, and may make tangible things available, as may be required for official use by any duly authorized officer or employee of the Commission under regulations which shall be promulgated by the Commission. Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), such material, things, and transcripts may be used by any such officer or employee in connection with the taking of oral testimony under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in this section, while in the possession of the custodian, no documentary material, tangible things, reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony shall be available for examination by any individual other than a duly authorized officer or employee of the Commission without the consent of the person who produced the material, things, or transcripts. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent disclosure to either House of the Congress or to any committee or subcommittee of the Congress, except that the Commission immediately shall notify the owner or provider of any such information of a request for information designated as confidential by the owner or provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) While in the possession of the custodian and under such reasonable terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) documentary material, tangible things, or written reports shall be available for examination by the person who produced the material, or by any duly authorized representative of such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) answers to questions in writing and transcripts of oral testimony shall be available for examination by the person who produced the testimony or by his attorney.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever the Commission has instituted a proceeding against a person, partnership, or corporation, the custodian may deliver to any officer or employee of the Commission documentary material, tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony for official use in connection with such proceeding. Upon the completion of the proceeding, the officer or employee shall return to the custodian any such material so delivered which has not been received into the record of the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If any documentary material, tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony have been produced in the course of any investigation by any person pursuant to compulsory process and—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any proceeding arising out of the investigation has been completed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time after completion of the examination and analysis of all such material and other information assembled in the course of the investigation;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the custodian shall, upon written request of the person who produced the material, return to the person any such material which has not been received into the record of any such proceeding (other than copies of such material made by the custodian pursuant to paragraph (3)(B)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The custodian of any documentary material, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony may deliver to any officers or employees of appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies, in response to a written request, copies of such material for use in connection with an investigation or proceeding under the jurisdiction of any such agency. The custodian of any tangible things may make such things available for inspection to such persons on the same basis. Such materials shall not be made available to any such agency until the custodian received certification of any officer of such agency that such information will be maintained in confidence and will be used only for official law enforcement purposes. Such documentary material, results of inspections of tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony may be used by any officer or employee of such agency only in such manner and subject to such conditions as apply to the Commission under this section. The custodian may make such materials available to any State law enforcement agency upon the prior certification of any officer of such agency that such information will be maintained in confidence and will be used only for official law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In the event of the death, disability, or separation from service in the Commission of the custodian of any documentary material, tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony produced under any demand issued under this subchapter, or the official relief of the custodian from responsibility for the custody and control of such material, the Commission promptly shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate under paragraph (2)(A) another duly authorized agent to serve as custodian of such material; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transmit in writing to the person who produced the material or testimony notice as to the identity and address of the successor so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any successor designated under paragraph (2)(A) as a result of the requirements of this paragraph shall have (with regard to the material involved) all duties and responsibilities imposed by this section upon his predecessor in office with regard to such material, except that he shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction which occurred before his designation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:69 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information considered confidential</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commission which is not subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall be considered confidential when so marked by the person supplying the information and shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the procedures established in paragraph (2) and paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that a document marked confidential by the person supplying it may be disclosed because it is not a trade secret or commercial or financial information which is obtained from any person and which is privileged or confidential, within the meaning of <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2001" section="46" title="15">section 46(f) of this title</uscode>, then the Commission shall notify such person in writing that the Commission intends to disclose the document at a date not less than 10 days after the date of receipt of notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person receiving such notification may, if he believes disclosure of the document would cause disclosure of a trade secret, or commercial or financial information which is obtained from any person and which is privileged or confidential, within the meaning of <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2001" section="46" title="15">section 46(f) of this title</uscode>, before the date set for release of the document, bring an action in the district court of the United States for the district within which the documents are located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to restrain disclosure of the document. Any person receiving such notification may file with the appropriate district court or court of appeals of the United States, as appropriate, an application for a stay of disclosure. The documents shall not be disclosed until the court has ruled on the application for a stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Particular disclosures allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall not be construed to prohibit—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the disclosure of information to either House of the Congress or to any committee or subcommittee of the Congress, except that the Commission immediately shall notify the owner or provider of any such information of a request for information designated as confidential by the owner or provider;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disclosure of the results of any investigation or study carried out or prepared by the Commission, except that no information shall be identified nor shall information be disclosed in such a manner as to disclose a trade secret of any person supplying the trade secret, or to disclose any commercial or financial information which is obtained from any person and which is privileged or confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the disclosure of relevant and material information in Commission adjudicative proceedings or in judicial proceedings to which the Commission is a party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the disclosure to a Federal agency of disaggregated information obtained in accordance with section 3512 <sup><a href="#57b-2_1_target" name="57b-2_1">1</a></sup> of title 44, except that the recipient agency shall use such disaggregated information for economic, statistical, or policymaking purposes only, and shall not disclose such information in an individually identifiable form.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any disclosure of relevant and material information in Commission adjudicative proceedings or in judicial proceedings to which the Commission is a party shall be governed by the rules of the Commission for adjudicative proceedings or by court rules or orders, except that the rules of the Commission shall not be amended in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect on other statutory provisions limiting disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall supersede any statutory provision which expressly prohibits or limits particular disclosures by the Commission, or which authorizes disclosures to any other Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exemption from disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any material which is received by the Commission in any investigation, a purpose of which is to determine whether any person may have violated any provision of the laws administered by the Commission, and which is provided pursuant to any compulsory process under this subchapter or which is provided voluntarily in place of such compulsory process shall be exempt from disclosure under <uscode edition="2001" section="552" title="5">section 552 of title 5</uscode>.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>

Such term does not include any amendment to a rule unless the Commission—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) estimates that such amendment will have an annual effect on the national economy of $100,000,000 or more;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) estimates that such amendment will cause a substantial change in the cost or price of goods or services which are used extensively by particular industries, which are supplied extensively in particular geographic regions, or which are acquired in significant quantities by the Federal Government, or by State or local governments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) otherwise determines that such amendment will have a significant impact upon persons subject to regulation under such amendment and upon consumers.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “rulemaking” means any Commission process for formulating or amending a rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of proposed rulemaking; regulatory analysis; contents; issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the Commission publishes notice of a proposed rulemaking, the Commission shall issue a preliminary regulatory analysis relating to the proposed rule involved. Each preliminary regulatory analysis shall contain—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a concise statement of the need for, and the objectives of, the proposed rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed rule which may accomplish the stated objective of the rule in a manner consistent with applicable law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for the proposed rule, and for each of the alternatives described in the analysis, a preliminary analysis of the projected benefits and any adverse economic effects and any other effects, and of the effectiveness of the proposed rule and each alternative in meeting the stated objectives of the proposed rule.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the Commission promulgates a final rule, the Commission shall issue a final regulatory analysis relating to the final rule. Each final regulatory analysis shall contain—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a concise statement of the need for, and the objectives of, the final rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of any alternatives to the final rule which were considered by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an analysis of the projected benefits and any adverse economic effects and any other effects of the final rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) an explanation of the reasons for the determination of the Commission that the final rule will attain its objectives in a manner consistent with applicable law and the reasons the particular alternative was chosen; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In order to avoid duplication or waste, the Commission is authorized to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consider a series of closely related rules as one rule for purposes of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whenever appropriate, incorporate any data or analysis contained in a regulatory analysis issued under this subsection in the statement of basis and purpose to accompany any rule promulgated under <uscode detail="(a)(1)(B)" edition="2001" section="57a" title="15">section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title</uscode>, and incorporate by reference in any preliminary or final regulatory analysis information contained in a notice of proposed rulemaking or a statement of basis and purpose.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall include, in each notice of proposed rulemaking and in each publication of a final rule, a statement of the manner in which the public may obtain copies of the preliminary and final regulatory analyses. The Commission may charge a reasonable fee for the copying and mailing of regulatory analyses. The regulatory analyses shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if the Commission determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information primarily benefits the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission is authorized to delay the completion of any of the requirements established in this subsection by publishing in the Federal Register, not later than the date of publication of the final rule involved, a finding that the final rule is being promulgated in response to an emergency which makes timely compliance with the provisions of this subsection impracticable. Such publication shall include a statement of the reasons for such finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed to alter in any manner the substantive standards applicable to any action by the Commission, or the procedural standards otherwise applicable to such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The contents and adequacy of any regulatory analysis prepared or issued by the Commission under this section, including the adequacy of any procedure involved in such preparation or issuance, shall not be subject to any <!-- PDFPage:71 -->judicial review in any court, except that a court, upon review of a rule pursuant to <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2001" section="57a" title="15">section 57a(e) of this title</uscode>, may set aside such rule if the Commission has failed entirely to prepare a regulatory analysis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as specified in paragraph (1), no Commission action may be invalidated, remanded, or otherwise affected by any court on account of any failure to comply with the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this subsection do not alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulatory agenda; contents; publication dates in Federal Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall publish at least semiannually a regulatory agenda. Each regulatory agenda shall contain a list of rules which the Commission intends to propose or promulgate during the 12-month period following the publication of the agenda. On the first Monday in October of each year, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register a schedule showing the dates during the current fiscal year on which the semiannual regulatory agenda of the Commission will be published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For each rule listed in a regulatory agenda, the Commission shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) describe the rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) state the objectives of and the legal basis for the rule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify any dates established or anticipated by the Commission for taking action, including dates for advance notice of proposed rulemaking, notices of proposed rulemaking, and final action by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each regulatory agenda shall state the name, office address, and office telephone number of the Commission officer or employee responsible for responding to any inquiry relating to each rule listed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall not propose or promulgate a rule which was not listed on a regulatory agenda unless the Commission publishes with the rule an explanation of the reasons the rule was omitted from such agenda.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Every association which engages solely in export trade, within thirty days after its creation, shall file with the Federal Trade Commission a verified written statement setting forth the location of its offices or places of business and the names and addresses of all its officers and of all its stockholders or members, and if a corporation, a copy of its certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws, and if unincorporated, a copy of its articles or contract of association, and on the 1st day of January of each year every association engaged solely in export trade shall make a like statement of the location of its offices or places of business and the names and addresses of all its officers and of all its stockholders or members and of all amendments to and changes in its articles or certificate of incorporation or in its articles or contract of association. It shall also furnish to the Commission such information as the Commission may require as to its organization business, conduct, <!-- PDFPage:74 -->practices, management, and relation to other associations, corporations, partnerships, and individuals. Any association which shall fail so to do shall not have the benefit of the provisions of <uscode edition="2001" range="62 and 63" section="62" title="15">sections 62 and 63 of this title</uscode>, and it shall also forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each and every day of the continuance of such failure, which forfeiture shall be payable into the Treasury of the United States, and shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the United States brought in the district where the association has its principal office, or in any district in which it shall do business. It shall be the duty of the various United States attorneys, under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, to prosecute for the recovery of the forfeiture. The costs and expenses of such prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the courts of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Federal Trade Commission shall have reason to believe that an association or any agreement made or act done by such association is in restraint of trade within the United States or in restraint of the export trade of any domestic competitor of such association, or that an association either in the United States or elsewhere has entered into any agreement, understanding, or conspiracy, or done any act which artificially or intentionally enhances or depresses prices within the United States of commodities of the class exported by such association, or which substantially lessens competition within the United States or otherwise restrains trade therein, it shall summon such association, its officers, and agents to appear before it, and thereafter conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of law. Upon investigation, if it shall conclude that the law has been violated, it may make to such association recommendations for the readjustment of its business, in order that it may thereafter maintain its organization and management and conduct its business in accordance with law. If such association fails to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Trade Commission, said Commission shall refer its findings and recommendations to the Attorney General of the United States for such action thereon as he may deem proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of enforcing these provisions the Federal Trade Commission shall have all the powers, so far as applicable, given it in the Federal Trade Commission Act [<uscode edition="2001" section="41" title="15">15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.</uscode>].</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Location of label, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, any wool product shall be misbranded if a stamp, tag, label, or other identification conforming to the requirements of this section is not on or affixed to the inside center of the neck midway between the shoulder seams or, if such product does not contain a neck, in the most conspicuous place on the inner side of such product, unless it is on or affixed on the outer side of such product or in the case of hosiery items, on the outer side of such product or package.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The constituent fiber or combination of fibers in the textile fiber product, designating with equal prominence each natural or manufactured fiber in the textile fiber product by its generic name in the order of predominance by the weight thereof if the weight of such fiber is 5 per centum or more of the total fiber weight of the product, but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the use of a nondeceptive trademark in conjunction with a designated generic name: <em>Provided</em>, That exclusive of permissible ornamentation, any fiber or group of fibers present in an amount of 5 per centum or less by weight of the total fiber content shall not be designated by the generic name or the trademark of such fiber or fibers, but shall be designated only as “other fiber” or “other fibers” as the case may be, but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure of any fiber present in a textile fiber product which has a clearly established and definite functional significance where present in the amount contained in such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The percentage of each fiber present, by weight, in the total fiber content of the textile fiber product, exclusive of ornamentation not exceeding 5 per centum by weight of the total fiber content: <em>Provided</em>, That, exclusive of permissible ornamentation, any fiber or group of fibers present in an amount of 5 per centum or less by weight of the total fiber content shall not be designated by the generic name or trademark of such fiber or fibers, but shall be designated only as “other fiber” or “other fibers” as the case may be but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure of any fiber present in a textile fiber product which has a clearly established and definite functional significance where present in the amount stated: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the case of a textile fiber product which contains more than one kind of fiber, deviation in the fiber content of any fiber in such product, from the amount stated on the stamp, tag, label, or other identification shall not be a misbranding under this section unless such deviation is in excess of reasonable tolerances which shall be established by the Commission: <em>And provided further</em>, That any such deviation which exceeds said tolerances shall not be a misbranding if the person charged proves that the deviation resulted from unavoidable variations in manufacture and despite due care to make accurate the statements on the tag, stamp, label, or other identification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The name, or other identification issued and registered by the Commission, of the manufacturer of the product or one or more persons subject to <uscode edition="2001" section="70a" title="15">section 70a of this title</uscode> with respect to such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If it is an imported textile fiber product the name of the country where processed or manufactured.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) False or deceptive advertisement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised if any disclosure or implication of fiber content is made in any written advertisement which is used to aid, promote, or assist directly or indirectly in the sale or offering for sale of such textile fiber product, unless the same information as that required to be shown on the stamp, tag, label, or other identification under subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section is contained in the heading, body, or other part of such written advertisement, except that the percentages of the fiber present in the textile fiber product need not be stated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional information allowed</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Advertisement of textile product by use of name or symbol of fur-bearing animal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised if the name or symbol of any fur-bearing animal is used in the advertisement of such product unless such product, or the part thereof in connection with which the name or symbol of a fur-bearing animal is used, is a fur or fur product within the meaning of the Fur Products Labeling Act [<uscode edition="2001" section="69" title="15">15 U.S.C. 69 et seq.</uscode>]: <em>Provided, however</em>, That where a textile fiber product contains the hair or fiber of a fur-bearing animal, the name of such animal, in conjunction with the word “fiber”, “hair”, or “blend”, may be used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Reused stuffing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be misbranded if it is used as stuffing in any upholstered product, mattress, or cushion after having been previously used as stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion, unless the upholstered product, mattress, or cushion containing such textile fiber product bears a stamp, tag, or label approved by the Commission indicating in words plainly legible that it contains reused stuffing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Mail order catalog or promotional material</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised in any mail order catalog or mail order promotional material which is used in the direct sale or direct offering for sale of such textile fiber product, unless such textile fiber product description states in a clear and conspicuous manner that such textile fiber product is processed or manufactured in the United States of America, or imported, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Location of stamp, tag, label, or other identification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, any textile fiber product shall be misbranded if a stamp, tag, label, or other identification conforming to the requirements of this section is not on or affixed to the inside center of the neck midway between the shoulder seams or, if such product does not contain a neck, in the most conspicuous place on the inner side of such product, unless it is on or affixed on the outer side of such product, or in the case of hosiery items on the outer side of such product or package.</p>
