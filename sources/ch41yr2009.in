<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Informed use of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms of personal property leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1604. Disclosure guidelines</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation, contents, etc., of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Except in the case of a mortgage referred to in <uscode detail="(aa)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(aa) of this title</uscode>, these regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Model disclosure forms and clauses; publication, criteria, compliance, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall publish model disclosure forms and clauses for common transactions to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of this subchapter and to aid the borrower or lessee in understanding the transaction by utilizing readily understandable language to simplify the technical nature of the disclosures. In devising such forms, the Board shall consider the use by creditors or lessors of data processing or similar automated equipment. Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this section. A creditor or lessor shall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure provisions of this subchapter with respect to other than numerical disclosures if the creditor or lessor (1) uses any appropriate model form or clause as published by the Board, or (2) uses any such model form or clause and changes it by (A) deleting any information which is not required by this subchapter, or (B) rearranging the format, if in making such deletion or rearranging the format, the creditor or lessor does not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures applicable for adoption of model forms and clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Model disclosure forms and clauses shall be adopted by the Board after notice duly given in the Federal Register and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with <uscode edition="2009" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective dates of regulations containing new disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any regulation of the Board, or any amendment or interpretation thereof, requiring any disclosure which differs from the disclosures previously required by this part, part D, or part E of this subchapter or by any regulation of the Board promulgated thereunder shall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation, except that the Board may at its discretion take interim action by regulation, amendment, or interpretation to lengthen the period of time permitted for creditors or lessors to adjust their forms to accommodate new requirements or shorten the length of time for creditors or lessors to make such adjustments when it makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent unfair or deceptive disclosure practices. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, any creditor or lessor may comply with any such newly promulgated disclosure requirements prior to the effective date of the requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) <sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> Exemption authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may exempt, by regulation, from all or part of this subchapter any class of transactions, other than transactions involving any mortgage described in <uscode detail="(aa)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(aa) of this title</uscode>, for which, in the determination of the Board, coverage under all or part of this subchapter does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining which classes of transactions to exempt in whole or in part under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider the following factors and publish its rationale at the time a proposed exemption is published for comment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The amount of the loan and whether the disclosures, right of rescission, and other provisions provide a benefit to the consumers who are parties to such transactions, as determined by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The extent to which the requirements of this subchapter complicate, hinder, or make more expensive the credit process for the class of transactions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1135 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The status of the borrower, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any related financial arrangements of the borrower, as determined by the Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under this subchapter, as determined by the Board;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the goal of consumer protection would be undermined by such an exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Waiver for certain borrowers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, by regulation, may exempt from the requirements of this subchapter certain credit transactions if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction involves a consumer—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with an annual earned income of more than $200,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) having net assets in excess of $1,000,000 at the time of the transaction; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a waiver that is handwritten, signed, and dated by the consumer is first obtained from the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments by the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, at its discretion, may adjust the annual earned income and net asset requirements of paragraph (1) for inflation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1605. Determination of finance charge</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) “Finance charge” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the finance charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be determined as the sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. The finance charge shall not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents (including settlement agents, attorneys, and escrow and title companies) if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges. Examples of charges which are included in the finance charge include any of the following types of charges which are applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Interest, time price differential, and any amount payable under a point, discount, or other system or additional charges.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Life, accident, or health insurance premiums included in finance charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance written in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charges unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the coverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in order to obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the person to whom the credit is extended must give specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Property damage and liability insurance premiums included in finance charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for insurance, written in connection with any consumer credit transaction, against loss of or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of property, shall be included in the finance charge unless a clear and specific statement in writing is furnished by the creditor to the person to whom the credit is extended, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the creditor, and stating that the person to whom the credit is extended may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in all credit transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any of the following items is itemized and disclosed in accordance with the regulations of the Board in connection with any transaction, then the creditor need not include that item in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees and charges prescribed by law which actually are or will be paid to public officials <!-- PDFPage:1136 -->for determining the existence of or for perfecting or releasing or satisfying any security related to the credit transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The premium payable for any insurance in lieu of perfecting any security interest otherwise required by the creditor in connection with the transaction, if the premium does not exceed the fees and charges described in paragraph (1) which would otherwise be payable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any tax levied on security instruments or on documents evidencing indebtedness if the payment of such taxes is a precondition for recording the instrument securing the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in extensions of credit secured by an interest in real property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following items, when charged in connection with any extension of credit secured by an interest in real property, shall not be included in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees or premiums for title examination, title insurance, or similar purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Fees for preparation of loan-related documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escrows for future payments of taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fees for notarizing deeds and other documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Appraisal fees, including fees related to any pest infestation or flood hazard inspections conducted prior to closing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Credit reports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tolerances for accuracy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with credit transactions not under an open end credit plan that are secured by real property or a dwelling, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the amount disclosed as the finance charge—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $100; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is greater than the amount required to be disclosed under this subchapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of <uscode edition="2009" section="1635" title="15">section 1635 of this title</uscode> if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than an amount equal to one-half of one percent of the total amount of credit extended; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a transaction, other than a mortgage referred to in <uscode detail="(aa)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(aa) of this title</uscode>, which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a refinancing of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of a residential mortgage transaction as defined in <uscode detail="(w)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(w) of this title</uscode>, or is any subsequent refinancing of such a transaction; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) “Annual percentage rate” defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annual percentage rate applicable to any extension of consumer credit shall be determined, in accordance with the regulations of the Board,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of any extension of credit other than under an open end credit plan, as</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that nominal annual percentage rate which will yield a sum equal to the amount of the finance charge when it is applied to the unpaid balances of the amount financed, calculated according to the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt between the amount financed and the amount of the finance charge, pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the accumulated finance charge and the balance is applied to the unpaid amount financed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rate determined by any method prescribed by the Board as a method which materially simplifies computation while retaining reasonable accuracy as compared with the rate determined under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of any extension of credit under an open end credit plan, as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of the total finance charge for the period to which it relates divided by the amount upon which the finance charge for that period is based, multiplied by the number of such periods in a year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of rate of finance charges for balances within a specified range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a creditor imposes the same finance charge for balances within a specified range, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on the median balance within the range, except that if the Board determines that a rate so computed would not be meaningful, or would be materially misleading, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on such other basis as the Board may be regulation require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowable tolerances for purposes of compliance with disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The disclosure of an annual percentage rate is accurate for the purpose of this subchapter if the rate disclosed is within a tolerance not greater than one-eighth of 1 per centum more or less than the actual rate or rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 per centum. The Board may allow a greater tolerance to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of rate tables or charts having allowable variance from determined rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may authorize the use of rate tables or charts which may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which vary from the rate determined in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section by not more than such tolerances as the Board may allow. The Board may not allow a tolerance greater than 8 per centum of that rate except to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of tolerances in determining annual percentage rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of creditors determining the annual percentage rate in a manner other than as described in subsection (d) of this section, the Board may authorize other reasonable tolerances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out its enforcement activities under this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and is authorized in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, (A) each agency shall apply (i) with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2009" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, and (ii) with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate; except that (B) with respect to transactions consummated after two years following March 31, 1980, each agency shall apply (i) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten years or less, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2009" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, but in no event a tolerance of less than the tolerances allowed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2009" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, (ii) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under <uscode detail="(c)" edition="2009" section="1606" title="15">section 1606(c) of this title</uscode>, and (iii) for all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall require such an adjustment when it determines that such disclosure error resulted from (A) a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, (B) gross negligence, or (C) a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error re<!-- PDFPage:1139 -->sulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, an agency need not require such an adjustment if it determines that such disclosure error—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving the disclosures described in sections 1605(b), (c) and (d) of this title, in which event the agency may require such remedial action as it determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after two years after March 31, 1980, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2009" section="1605" title="15">section 1605(b) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involved a disclosed amount which was 10 per centum or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable; or</p>

<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of other such disclosure errors, each agency may require such an adjustment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), no adjustment shall be ordered—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the agency may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the agency considers to be reasonable, if (in the case of an agency referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) of this section), the agency determines that a partial adjustment or making partial payments over an extended period is necessary to avoid causing the creditor to become undercapitalized pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode edition="2009" section="1831" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1831</uscode><em>o</em>];</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to creditors that are subject to examination by the agencies referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of examination in which such practices were first identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to creditors that are not subject to examination by such agencies, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an adjustment under this subsection may be required by an agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section only by an order issued in accordance with cease and desist procedures provided by the provision of law referred to in such subsections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In case of an agency which is not authorized to conduct cease and desist proceedings, such an order may be issued after an agency hearing on the record conducted at least thirty but not more than sixty days after notice of the alleged violation is served on the creditor. Such a hearing shall be deemed to be a hearing which is subject to the provisions of section 8(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [<uscode detail="(h)" edition="2009" section="1818" title="12">12 U.S.C. 1818(h)</uscode>] and shall be subject to judicial review as provided therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any provision of law referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, no agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section may require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under this subchapter, except with regard to the requirements of <uscode edition="2009" section="1666d" title="15">section 1666d of this title</uscode>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, this part and parts B and C of this subchapter, do not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Board, the Board shall determine whether any such inconsistency exists. If the Board determines that a State-required disclosure is inconsistent, creditors located in that State may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or form, and shall incur no liability under the law of that State for failure to use such term or form, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Board, the Board shall determine whether any disclosure required under the law of any State is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required under this subchapter. If the Board determines that a State-required disclosure is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required by this subchapter, then creditors located in that State may make such disclosure in compliance with such State law in lieu of the disclosure required by this subchapter, except that the annual percentage rate and finance charge shall be disclosed as required by <uscode edition="2009" section="1632" title="15">section 1632 of this title</uscode>, and such State-required disclosure may not be made in lieu of the disclosures applicable to certain mortgages under <uscode edition="2009" section="1639" title="15">section 1639 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Duty of creditor or lessor respecting one or more than one obligor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a creditor or lessor shall disclose to the person who is obligated on a consumer lease or a consumer credit transaction the information required under this subchapter. In a transaction involving more than one obligor, a creditor or lessor, except in a transaction under <uscode edition="2009" section="1635" title="15">section 1635 of this title</uscode>, need not disclose to more than one of such obligors if the obligor given disclosure is a primary obligor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Creditor or lessor required to make disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a transaction involves one creditor as defined in <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(f) of this title</uscode>, or one lessor as defined in <uscode detail="(3)" edition="2009" section="1667" title="15">section 1667(3) of this title</uscode>, such creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures. If a transaction involves more than one creditor or lessor, only one creditor or lessor shall by required to make the disclosures. The Board shall by regulation specify which creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estimates as satisfying statutory requirements; basis of disclosure for per diem interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may provide by regulation that any portion of the information required to be disclosed by this subchapter may be given in the form of estimates where the provider of such information is not in a position to know exact information. In the case of any consumer credit transaction a portion of the interest on which is determined on a per diem basis and is to be collected upon the consummation of such transaction, any disclosure with respect to such portion of interest shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the disclosure is based on information actually known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are being prepared for the consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tolerances for numerical disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall determine whether tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate are necessary to facilitate compliance with this subchapter, and if it determines that such tolerances are necessary to facilitate compliance, it shall by regulation permit disclosures within such tolerances. The Board shall exercise its authority to permit tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate so that such tolerances are narrow enough to prevent such tolerances from resulting in misleading disclosures or disclosures that circumvent the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Information clearly and conspicuously disclosed; “annual percentage rate” and “finance charge”; order of disclosures and use of different terminology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Information required by this subchapter shall be disclosed clearly and conspicuously, in accordance with regulations of the Board. The terms “annual percentage rate” and “finance charge” shall be disclosed more conspicuously than other terms, data, or information provided in connection with a transaction, except information relating to the identify of the creditor. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, regulations of the Board need not require that disclosures pursuant to this subchapter be made in the order set forth in this subchapter and, except as otherwise provided, may permit the use of terminology different from that employed in this subchapter if it conveys substantially the same meaning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Optional information by creditor or lessor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any creditor or lessor may supply additional information or explanation with any disclosures required under parts D and E of this subchapter and, except as provided in <uscode detail="(b)(3)" edition="2009" range="1637a(b)(3) and 1638(b)(1)" section="1637a" title="15">sections 1637a(b)(3) and 1638(b)(1) of this title</uscode>, under this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides a clear and concise form for stating each item of information required to be disclosed under each such heading.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing the form of the table under subparagraph (A), the Board may—</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Grace period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Either the heading or the statement under the heading which relates to the time period referred to in <uscode detail="(c)(1)(A)(iii)" edition="2009" section="1637" title="15">section 1637(c)(1)(A)(iii) of this title</uscode> shall contain the term “grace period”.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Record repository</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall establish and maintain on its publicly available Internet site a central repository of the consumer credit card agreements received from creditors pursuant to this subsection, and such agreements shall be easily accessible and retrievable by the public.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exception</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">§1635. Right of rescission as to certain transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of any consumer credit transaction (including opening or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) in which a security interest, including any such interest arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Board, appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to rescind any transaction subject to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of money or property following rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the boligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modification and waiver of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may, if it finds that such action is necessary in order to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modifica<!-- PDFPage:1148 -->tion or waiver of any rights created under this section to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exempted transactions; reapplication of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a residential mortgage transaction as defined in <uscode detail="(w)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(w) of this title</uscode>;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transaction which constitutes a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a transaction in which an agency of a State is the creditor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) advances under a preexisting open end credit plan if a security interest has already been retained or acquired and such advances are in accordance with a previously established credit limit for such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limit for exercise of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under <uscode edition="2009" section="1640" title="15">section 1640 of this title</uscode> for violations of this subchapter not relating to the right to rescind.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitation on rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor shall have no rescission rights arising solely from the form of written notice used by the creditor to inform the obligor of the rights of the obligor under this section, if the creditor provided the obligor the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Board, or a comparable written notice of the rights of the obligor, that was properly completed by the creditor, and otherwise complied with all other requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rescission rights in foreclosure</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding <uscode edition="2009" section="1649" title="15">section 1649 of this title</uscode>, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f) of this section, in addition to any other right of rescission available under this section for a transaction, after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the primary dwelling of an obligor securing an extension of credit, the obligor shall have a right to rescind the transaction equivalent to other rescission rights provided by this section, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a mortgage broker fee is not included in the finance charge in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect at the time the consumer credit transaction was consummated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the form of notice of rescission for the transaction is not the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Board or a comparable written notice, and otherwise complied with all the requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tolerance for disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding <uscode detail="(f)" edition="2009" section="1605" title="15">section 1605(f) of this title</uscode>, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f) of this section, for the purposes of exercising any rescission rights after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the principal dwelling of the obligor securing an extension of credit, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this section if the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $35 or is greater than the amount required to be disclosed under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Right of recoupment under State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission in recoupment under State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The conditions under which a finance charge may be imposed, including the time period (if any) within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such finance charge if payment is received after the termination of such time period.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No election by a consumer under paragraph (1) shall take effect unless the consumer, before making such election, received a notice from the creditor of any over-the-limit fee in the form and manner, and at the time, determined by the Board.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a creditor from completing <!-- PDFPage:1157 -->an over-the-limit transaction, provided that a consumer who has not made a valid election under paragraph (1) is not charged an over-the-limit fee for such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Restriction on fees charged for an over-the-limit transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, an over-the-limit fee may be imposed only once during a billing cycle if the credit limit on the account is exceeded, and an over-the-limit fee, with respect to such excess credit, may be imposed only once in each of the 2 subsequent billing cycles, unless the consumer has obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during any such subsequent cycle or the consumer reduces the outstanding balance below the credit limit as of the end of such billing cycle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Limit on fees related to method of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor may not impose a separate fee to allow the obligor to repay an extension of credit or finance charge, whether such repayment is made by mail, electronic transfer, telephone authorization, or other means, unless such payment involves an expedited service by a service representative of the creditor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The identity of the creditor required to make disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The “amount financed”, using that term, which shall be the amount of credit of which the consumer has actual use. This amount shall be computed as follows, but the computations need not be disclosed and shall not be disclosed with the disclosures conspicuously segregated in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) take the principal amount of the loan or the cash price less downpayment and trade-in;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) subtract any charges which are part of the finance charge but which will be paid by the consumer before or at the time of the consummation of the transaction, or have been withheld from the proceeds of the credit.</p>

Upon receiving an affirmative indication, the creditor shall provide, at the time other disclosures are required to be furnished, a written itemization of the amount financed. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “itemization of the amount financed” means a disclosure of the following items, to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount that is or will be paid directly to the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount that is or will be credited to the consumer's account to discharge obligations owed to the creditor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) each amount that is or will be paid to third persons by the creditor on the consumer's behalf, together with an identification of or reference to the third person; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The “finance charge”, not itemized, using that term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The finance charge expressed as an “annual percentage rate”, using that term. This shall not be required if the amount financed does not exceed $75 and the finance charge does not exceed $5, or if the amount financed exceeds $75 and the finance charge does not exceed $7.50.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The sum of the amount financed and the finance charge, which shall be termed the “total of payments”.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The number, amount, and due dates or period of payments scheduled to repay the total of payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In a sale of property or services in which the seller is the creditor required to disclose pursuant to <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2009" section="1631" title="15">section 1631(b) of this title</uscode>, the “total sale price”, using that term, which shall be the total of the cash price of the property or services, additional charges, and the finance charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Descriptive explanations of the terms “amount financed”, “finance charge”, “annual percentage rate”, “total of payments”, and “total sale price” as specified by the Board. The descriptive explanation of “total sale price” shall include reference to the amount of the downpayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Where the credit is secured, a statement that a security interest has been taken in (A) the property which is purchased as part of the credit transaction, or (B) property not purchased as part of the credit transaction identified by item or type.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1639a. Duty of servicers of residential mortgages</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a servicer of residential mortgages agrees to enter into a qualified loss mitigation plan with respect to 1 or more residential mortgages originated before May 20, 2009, including mortgages held in a securitization or other investment vehicle—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to investors or other parties to maximize the net present value of such mortgages, the duty shall be construed to apply to all such investors and parties, and not to any individual party or group of parties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied the duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, before December 31, 2012, the servicer implements a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has occurred, is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as such terms are defined by guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [<uscode edition="2009" section="5201" title="12">12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.</uscode>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing the mortgage as his or her principal residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, that the application of such qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors or other parties under this section shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection (a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standard industry practice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The qualified loss mitigation plan guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [<uscode edition="2009" section="5201" title="12">12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.</uscode>] shall constitute standard industry practice for purposes of all Federal and State laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, including a trustee, issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each servicer that engages in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results of the servicer's modification activities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations or guidance specifying the form, content, and timing of such reports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term “qualified loss mitigation plan” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a residential loan modification, workout, or other loss mitigation plan, including to the extent that the Secretary of the Treasury determines appropriate, a loan sale, real property disposition, trial modification, pre-foreclosure sale, and deed in lieu of foreclosure, that is described or authorized in guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [<uscode edition="2009" section="5201" title="12">12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.</uscode>]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a refinancing of a mortgage under the Hope for Homeowners program;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term “servicer” means the person responsible for the servicing for others of residential mortgage loans (including of a pool of residential mortgage loans); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term “securitization vehicle” means a trust, special purpose entity, or other legal structure that is used to facilitate the issuing of securities, participation certificates, or similar instruments backed by or referring to a pool of assets that includes residential mortgages (or instruments that are related to residential mortgages such as credit-linked notes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of subsection (b) or (d) shall be construed as affecting the liability of any servicer or person as described in subsection (d) for actual fraud in the origination or servicing of a loan or in the implementation of a qualified loss mitigation plan, or for the violation of a State or Federal law, including laws regulating the origination of mortgage loans, commonly referred to as predatory lending laws.</p>

Examples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programing, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under this subchapter is not a bona fide error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability in transaction or lease involving multiple obligors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When there are multiple obligors in a consumer credit transaction or consumer lease, there shall be no more than one recovery of damages under subsection (a)(2) of this section for a violation of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation or, in the case of a violation involving a private education loan (as that term is defined in <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2009" section="1650" title="15">section 1650(a) of this title</uscode>), 1 year from the date on which the first regular payment of principal is due under the loan. This subsection does not bar a person from asserting a violation of this subchapter in an action to collect the debt which was brought more than one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off in such action, except as otherwise provided by State law. An action to enforce a violation of <uscode edition="2009" section="1639" title="15">section 1639 of this title</uscode> may also be brought by the appropriate State attorney general in any appropriate United States district court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, not later than 3 years after the date on which the violation occurs. The State attorney general shall provide prior written notice of any such civil action to the Federal agency responsible for enforcement under <uscode edition="2009" section="1607" title="15">section 1607 of this title</uscode> and shall provide the agency with a copy of the complaint. If prior notice is not feasible, the State attorney general shall provide notice to such agency immediately upon instituting the action. The Federal agency may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) intervene in the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon intervening—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) remove the action to the appropriate United States district court, if it was not originally brought there; and</p>

The preceding sentence does not affect rights of a consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section on the basis of an assignment of the obligation from the creditor or another assignee to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation. Upon written request by the obligor, the servicer shall provide the obligor, to the best knowledge of the servicer, with the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the obligation or the master servicer of the obligation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If any advertisement to aid, promote, or assist, directly or indirectly, the extension of consumer credit through an open end consumer credit plan under which extensions of credit are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling states, affirmatively or negatively, any of the specific terms of the plan, including any periodic payment amount required under such plan, such advertisement shall also clearly and conspicuously set forth the following information, in such form and manner as the Board may require:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Loan fees and opening cost estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any loan fee the amount of which is determined as a percentage of the credit limit applicable to an account under the plan and an estimate of the aggregate amount of other fees for opening the account, based on the creditor's experience with the plan and stated as a single amount or as a reasonable range.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section contains a statement that any interest expense incurred with respect to the plan is or may be tax deductible, the advertisement shall not be misleading with respect to such deductibility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit in excess of fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section that relates to an extension of credit that may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling, and which advertisement is disseminated in paper form to the public or through the Internet, as opposed to by radio or television, shall include a clear and conspicuous statement that—</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain terms prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section with respect to any home equity account may refer to such loan as “free money” or use other terms determined by the Board by regulation to be misleading.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and <uscode edition="2009" section="1637a" title="15">section 1637a of this title</uscode>, the term “balloon payment” means, with respect to any open end consumer credit plan under which extensions of credit are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, any repayment option under which—</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1666. Correction of billing errors</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Written notice by obligor to creditor; time for and contents of notice; procedure upon receipt of notice by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a creditor, within sixty days after having transmitted to an obligor a statement of the obligor's account in connection with an extension of consumer credit, receives at the address disclosed under <uscode detail="(b)(10)" edition="2009" section="1637" title="15">section 1637(b)(10) of this title</uscode> a written notice (other than notice on a payment stub or other payment medium supplied by the creditor if the creditor so stipulates with the disclosure required under <uscode detail="(a)(7)" edition="2009" section="1637" title="15">section 1637(a)(7) of this title</uscode>) from the obligor in which the obligor—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sets forth or otherwise enables the creditor to identify the name and account number (if any) of the obligor,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicates the obligor's belief that the statement contains a billing error and the amount of such billing error, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the obligor's belief (to the extent applicable) that the statement contains a billing error,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">the creditor shall, unless the obligor has, after giving such written notice and before the expiration of the time limits herein specified, agreed that the statement was correct—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not later than thirty days after the receipt of the notice, send a written acknowledgment thereof to the obligor, unless the action required in subparagraph (B) is taken within such thirty-day period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than two complete billing cycles of the creditor (in no event later than ninety days) after the receipt of the notice and prior to taking any action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) either—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) make appropriate corrections in the account of the obligor, including the crediting of any finance charges on amounts erroneously billed, and transmit to the obligor a notification of such corrections and the creditor's explanation of any change in the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) and, if any such change is made and the obligor so requests, copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request of the obligor, provide copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness. In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditor's billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">After complying with the provisions of this subsection with respect to an alleged billing error, a creditor has no further responsibility under this section if the obligor continues to make substantially the same allegation with respect to such error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, a “billing error” consists of any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit which was not made to the obligor or, if made, was not in the amount reflected on such statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit for which the obligor requests additional clarification including documentary evidence thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A reflection on a statement of goods or services not accepted by the obligor or his designee or not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The creditor's failure to reflect properly on a statement a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1189 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Failure to transmit the statement required under <uscode detail="(b)" edition="2009" section="1637" title="15">section 1637(b) of this title</uscode> to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Any other error described in regulations of the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by creditor to collect amount or any part thereof regarded by obligor to be a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, “action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by an obligor under paragraph (2)” does not include the sending of statements of account, which may include finance charges on amounts in dispute, to the obligor following written notice from the obligor as specified under subsection (a) of this section, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the obligor's account is not restricted or closed because of the failure of the obligor to pay the amount indicated under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the creditor indicates the payment of such amount is not required pending the creditor's compliance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any action by a creditor to collect any amount which has not been indicated by the obligor to contain a billing error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restricting or closing by creditor of account regarded by obligor to contain a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to regulations of the Board, a creditor operating an open end consumer credit plan may not, prior to the sending of the written explanation or clarification required under paragraph (B)(ii), restrict or close an account with respect to which the obligor has indicated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section that he believes such account to contain a billing error solely because of the obligor's failure to pay the amount indicated to be in error. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit a creditor from applying against the credit limit on the obligor's account the amount indicated to be in error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of noncompliance with requirements by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any creditor who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or <uscode edition="2009" section="1666a" title="15">section 1666a of this title</uscode> forfeits any right to collect from the obligor the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and any finance charges thereon, except that the amount required to be forfeited under this subsection may not exceed $50.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments received from an obligor under an open end consumer credit plan by the creditor shall be posted promptly to the obligor's account as specified in regulations of the Board. Such regulations shall prevent a finance charge from being imposed on any obligor if the creditor has received the obligor's payment in readily identifiable form, by 5:00 p.m. on the date on which such payment is due, in the amount, manner, and location indicated by the creditor to avoid the imposition thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receipt of a payment from a cardholder, the card issuer shall apply amounts in excess of the minimum payment amount first to the card balance bearing the highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the payment is exhausted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Clarification relating to certain deferred interest arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor shall allocate the entire amount paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum payment amount to a balance on which interest is deferred during the last 2 billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of the period during which interest is deferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Changes by card issuer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a card issuer makes a material change in the mailing address, office, or procedures for handling cardholder payments, and such change causes a material delay in the crediting of a cardholder payment made during the 60-day period following the date on which such change took effect, the card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the credit card account to which such payment was credited.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated <!-- PDFPage:1195 -->residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disadvantages of garnishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for personal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors’ remedy frequently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the resulting disruption of employment, production, and consumption constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The great disparities among the laws of the several States relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many areas of the country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessity for regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of this subchapter are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bankruptcy laws.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness <sup><a href="#1679_1_target" name="1679_1">1</a></sup> and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any credit repair organization shall provide any consumer with the following written statement before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><strong>“Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law</strong></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">“You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any ‘credit repair’ company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For more information contact:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Separate statement requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The written statement required under this section shall be provided as a document which is separate from any written contract or other agreement between the credit repair organization and the consumer or any other written material provided to the consumer.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1201 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retention of compliance records</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit repair organization shall maintain a copy of the statement signed by the consumer acknowledging receipt of the statement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maintenance for 2 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The copy of any consumer's statement shall be maintained in the organization's files for 2 years after the date on which the statement is signed by the consumer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness,<sup><a href="#1681_1_target" name="1681_1">1</a></sup> credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§1681c–2. Block of information resulting from identity theft</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a copy of an identity theft report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the information may be a result of identity theft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that an identity theft report has been filed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that a block has been requested under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) of the effective dates of the block.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to decline or rescind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification to consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under <uscode detail="(a)(5)(B)" edition="2009" section="1681i" title="15">section 1681i(a)(5)(B) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Significance of block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for resellers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No reseller file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a reseller;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity <!-- PDFPage:1221 -->theft to the Commission to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reseller with file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for verification companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="2009" section="1681a" title="15">section 1681a(p) of this title</uscode>, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) means a numerical value or a categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default (and the numerical value or the categorization derived from such analysis may also be referred to as a “risk predictor” or “risk score”); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not include—</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability to certain uses</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop scores that assist credit providers in understanding the general credit behavior of a consumer and predicting the future credit behavior of the consumer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subsection shall not be construed to require a consumer reporting agency that distributes credit scores developed by another person or entity to provide a further explanation of them, or to process a dispute arising pursuant to <uscode edition="2009" section="1681i" title="15">section 1681i of this title</uscode>, except that the consumer reporting agency shall provide the consumer with the name and address and website for contacting the person or entity who developed the score or developed the methodology of the score.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement indicating that the information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by the lender.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Fair and reasonable fee</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Use of enquiries as a key factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a key factor that adversely affects the credit score of a consumer consists of the number of enquiries made with respect to a consumer report, that factor shall be included in the disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) without regard to the numerical limitation in such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disclosure of credit scores by certain mortgage lenders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who makes or arranges loans and who uses a consumer credit score, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, in connection with an application initiated or sought by a consumer for a closed end loan or the establishment of an open end loan for a consumer purpose that is secured by 1 to 4 units of residential real property (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “lender”) shall provide the following to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable:</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Numerical credit score</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">However, if a numerical credit score is generated by an automated underwriting system used by an enterprise, and that score is disclosed to the person, the score shall be disclosed to the consumer consistent with subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Enterprise defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “enterprise” has the same meaning as in paragraph (6) of <uscode edition="2009" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of title 12</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Disclosures of credit scores not obtained from a consumer reporting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person that is subject to the provisions of this subsection and that uses a credit score, other than a credit score provided by a consumer reporting agency, may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Notice to home loan applicants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A copy of the following notice, which shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency providing a credit score that was used:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><cap-smallcap>“notice to the home loan applicant</cap-smallcap></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">“In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">“If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.”.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Actions not required under this subsection</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) provide more than 1 disclosure per loan transaction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1228 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) No obligation for content</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Person defined as excluding enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this subsection, the term “person” does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of <uscode edition="2009" section="4502" title="12">section 4502 of title 12</uscode>).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No liability for disclosure under this subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reinvestigation required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subsection (f) of this section, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer's file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph (5), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of period to reinvestigate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A) may be extended for not more than 15 additional days if the consumer reporting <!-- PDFPage:1230 -->agency receives information from the consumer during that 30-day period that is relevant to the reinvestigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any reinvestigation in which, during the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A), the information that is the subject of the reinvestigation is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or the consumer reporting agency determines that the information cannot be verified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt notice of dispute to furnisher of information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the expiration of the 5-business-day period beginning on the date on which a consumer reporting agency receives notice of a dispute from any consumer or a reseller in accordance with paragraph (1), the agency shall provide notification of the dispute to any person who provided any item of information in dispute, at the address and in the manner established with the person. The notice shall include all relevant information regarding the dispute that the agency has received from the consumer or reseller.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Provision of other information</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph (A) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Procedures to prevent reappearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to prevent the reappearance in a consumer's file, and in consumer reports on the consumer, of information that is deleted pursuant to this paragraph (other than information that is reinserted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(i)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Automated reinvestigation system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis shall implement an automated system through which furnishers of information to that consumer reporting agency may report the results of a reinvestigation that finds incomplete or inaccurate information in a consumer's file to other such consumer reporting agencies.</p>

<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003] (commonly referred to as ‘FACTA’) [<plaw congress="108" isprivate="false" number="159">Pub. L. 108–159,</plaw> see Short Title of 2003 Amendment note set out under <uscode edition="2009" section="1601" title="15">section 1601 of this title</uscode>] was enacted into law in 2003 and 1 of the purposes of such Act is to prevent criminals from obtaining access to consumers’ private financial and credit information in order to reduce identity theft and credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) As part of that law, the Congress enacted a requirement, through an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act [<uscode edition="2009" section="1681" title="15">15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.</uscode>], that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) Many merchants understood that this requirement would be satisfied by truncating the account number down to the last 5 digits based in part on the language of the provision as well as the publicity in the aftermath of the passage of the law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) Almost immediately after the deadline for compliance passed, hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act even where the account number was properly truncated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) None of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer's identity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) Experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, by itself as required by the amendment made by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003], regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) Despite repeatedly being denied class certification, the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No address requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who clearly and conspicuously specifies to the consumer an address for notices referred to in subparagraph (B) shall not be subject to subparagraph (A); however, nothing in subparagraph (B) shall require a person to specify such an address.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate” means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty to correct and update information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the person's transactions or experiences with any consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate,</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections to that information, or any additional information, that is necessary to make the information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not complete or accurate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Duty to provide notice of dispute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Duty to provide notice of closed accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a consumer who has a credit account with that person shall notify the agency of the voluntary closure of the account by the consumer, in information regularly furnished for the period in which the account is closed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1247 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duty to provide notice of delinquency of accounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall, not later than 90 days after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph only, and provided that the consumer does not dispute the information, a person that furnishes information on a delinquent account that is placed for collection, charged for profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, complies with this paragraph, if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person reports the same date of delinquency as that provided by the creditor to which the account was owed at the time at which the commencement of the delinquency occurred, if the creditor previously reported that date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency, and the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to obtain the date of delinquency from the creditor or another reliable source and reports that date to a consumer reporting agency as the date of delinquency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency and the date of delinquency cannot be reasonably obtained as provided in clause (ii), the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to ensure the date reported as the date of delinquency precedes the date on which the account is placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, and reports such date to the credit reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Duties of furnishers upon notice of identity theft-related information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person that furnishes information to any consumer reporting agency shall have in place reasonable procedures to respond to any notification that it receives from a consumer reporting agency under section 1681c–2 of this title relating to information resulting from identity theft, to prevent that person from refurnishing such blocked information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Information alleged to result from identity theft</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a consumer submits an identity theft report to a person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency at the address specified by that person for receiving such reports stating that information maintained by such person that purports to relate to the consumer resulted from identity theft, the person may not furnish such information that purports to relate to the consumer to any consumer reporting agency, unless the person subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Negative information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice to consumer required</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any financial institution that extends credit and regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency described in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="2009" section="1681a" title="15">section 1681a(p) of this title</uscode> furnishes negative information to such an agency regarding credit extended to a customer, the financial institution shall provide a notice of such furnishing of negative information, in writing, to the customer.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice effective for subsequent submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">After providing such notice, the financial institution may submit additional negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="2009" section="1681a" title="15">section 1681a(p) of this title</uscode> with respect to the same transaction, extension of credit, account, or customer without providing additional notice to the customer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time of notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The notice required under subparagraph (A) shall be provided to the customer prior to, or no later than 30 days after, furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in <uscode detail="(p)" edition="2009" section="1681a" title="15">section 1681a(p) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Coordination with new account disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the notice is provided to the customer prior to furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency, the notice may not be included in the initial disclosures provided under <uscode detail="(a)" edition="2009" section="1637" title="15">section 1637(a) of this title</uscode>.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coordination with other disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice required under subparagraph (A)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may be included on or with any notice of default, any billing statement, or any other materials provided to the customer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must be clear and conspicuous.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Model disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Duty of Board to prepare</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Board shall prescribe a brief model disclosure a financial institution may use to comply with subparagraph (A), which shall not exceed 30 words.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use of model not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution to use any such model form prescribed by the Board.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1248 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Compliance using model</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A financial institution shall be deemed to be in compliance with subparagraph (A) if the financial institution uses any such model form prescribed by the Board, or the financial institution uses any such model form and rearranges its format.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Use of notice without submitting negative information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution that has provided a customer with a notice described in subparagraph (A) to furnish negative information about the customer to a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A financial institution shall not be liable for failure to perform the duties required by this paragraph if, at the time of the failure, the financial institution maintained reasonable policies and procedures to comply with this paragraph or the financial institution reasonably believed that the institution is prohibited, by law, from contacting the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Negative information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term “negative information” means information concerning a customer's delinquencies, late payments, insolvency, or any form of default.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Customer; financial institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The terms “customer” and “financial institution” have the same meanings as in <uscode edition="2009" section="6809" title="15">section 6809 of this title</uscode>.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Commission shall jointly prescribe regulations that shall identify the circumstances under which a furnisher shall be required to reinvestigate a dispute concerning the accuracy of information contained in a consumer report on the consumer, based on a direct request of a consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A), the agencies shall weigh—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the benefits to consumers with the costs on furnishers and the credit reporting system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact on the overall accuracy and integrity of consumer reports of any such requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) whether direct contact by the consumer with the furnisher would likely result in the most expeditious resolution of any such dispute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the potential impact on the credit reporting process if credit repair organizations, as defined in <uscode detail="(3)" edition="2009" section="1679a" title="15">section 1679a(3) of this title</uscode>, including entities that would be a credit repair organization, but for <uscode detail="(3)(B)(i)" edition="2009" section="1679a" title="15">section 1679a(3)(B)(i) of this title</uscode>, are able to circumvent the prohibition in subparagraph (G).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Frivolous or irrelevant dispute</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall not apply if the person receiving a notice of a dispute from a consumer reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by reason of the failure of a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consumer is provided an opportunity and a simple method to prohibit the making of such solicitations to the consumer by such person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consumer choice</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) using information to perform services on behalf of another person related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, except that this subparagraph shall not be construed as permitting a person to send solicitations on behalf of another person, if such other person would not be permitted to send the solicitation on its own behalf as a result of the election of the consumer to prohibit solicitations under paragraph (1)(B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) using information in response to a communication initiated by the consumer;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requests for signature of husband and wife for creation of valid lien, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for the signature of both parties to a marriage for the purpose of creating a valid lien, passing clear title, waiving inchoate rights to property, or assigning earnings, shall not constitute discrimination under this subchapter: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this provision shall not be construed to permit a creditor to take sex or marital status into account in connection with the evaluation of creditworthiness of any applicant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State property laws affecting creditworthiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consideration or application of State property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State laws prohibiting separate extension of consumer credit to husband and wife</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any provision of State law which prohibits the separate extension of consumer credit to each party to a marriage shall not apply in any case where each party to a marriage voluntarily applies for separate credit from the same creditor: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where such a State law is so preempted, each party to the marriage shall be solely responsible for the debt so contracted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Combining credit accounts of husband and wife with same creditor to determine permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under Federal or State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When each party to a marriage separately and voluntarily applies for and obtains separate credit accounts with the same creditor, those accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or permissible loan ceilings under the laws of any State or of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Election of remedies under subchapter or State law; nature of relief determining applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the same act or omission constitutes a violation of this subchapter and of applicable State law, a person aggrieved by such conduct may bring a legal action to recover monetary damages either under this subchapter or under such State law, but not both. This election of remedies shall not apply to court actions in which the relief sought does not include monetary damages or to administrative actions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with inconsistent State laws; determination of inconsistency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to credit discrimination, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. The Board is authorized to determine whether such inconsistencies exist.

In determining the amount of such damages in any action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditor's failure of compliance was intentional.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Abusive practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inadequacy of laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Existing laws and procedures for redressing these injuries are inadequate to protect consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Available non-abusive collection methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Means other than misrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1267 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Abusive debt collection practices are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate commerce and through means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment of certain private entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), a private entity shall be excluded from the definition of a debt collector, pursuant to the exception provided in <uscode detail="(6)" edition="2009" section="1692a" title="15">section 1692a(6) of this title</uscode>, with respect to the operation by the entity of a program described in paragraph (2)(A) under a contract described in paragraph (2)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conditions of applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a State or district attorney establishes, within the jurisdiction of such State or district attorney and with respect to alleged bad check violations that do not involve a check described in subsection (b), a <!-- PDFPage:1274 -->pretrial diversion program for alleged bad check offenders who agree to participate voluntarily in such program to avoid criminal prosecution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a private entity, that is subject to an administrative support services contract with a State or district attorney and operates under the direction, supervision, and control of such State or district attorney, operates the pretrial diversion program described in subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the course of performing duties delegated to it by a State or district attorney under the contract, the private entity referred to in subparagraph (B)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) complies with the penal laws of the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) conforms with the terms of the contract and directives of the State or district attorney;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) contacts any alleged offender referred to in subparagraph (A) for purposes of participating in a program referred to in such paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) only as a result of any determination by the State or district attorney that probable cause of a bad check violation under State penal law exists, and that contact with the alleged offender for purposes of participation in the program is appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the alleged offender has failed to pay the bad check after demand for payment, pursuant to State law, is made for payment of the check amount;</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) includes as part of an initial written communication with an alleged offender a clear and conspicuous statement that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the alleged offender may dispute the validity of any alleged bad check violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) where the alleged offender knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that the alleged bad check violation is the result of theft or forgery of the check, identity theft, or other fraud that is not the result of the conduct of the alleged offender, the alleged offender may file a crime report with the appropriate law enforcement agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) if the alleged offender notifies the private entity or the district attorney in writing, not later than 30 days after being contacted for the first time pursuant to clause (iv), that there is a dispute pursuant to this subsection, before further restitution efforts are pursued, the district attorney or an employee of the district attorney authorized to make such a determination makes a determination that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed; and</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) charges only fees in connection with services under the contract that have been authorized by the contract with the State or district attorney.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain checks excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A check is described in this subsection if the check involves, or is subsequently found to involve—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a postdated check presented in connection with a payday loan, or other similar transaction, where the payee of the check knew that the issuer had insufficient funds at the time the check was made, drawn, or delivered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a stop payment order where the issuer acted in good faith and with reasonable cause in stopping payment on the check;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a check dishonored because of an adjustment to the issuer's account by the financial institution holding such account without providing notice to the person at the time the check was made, drawn, or delivered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a check for partial payment of a debt where the payee had previously accepted partial payment for such debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a check issued by a person who was not competent, or was not of legal age, to enter into a legal contractual obligation at the time the check was made, drawn, or delivered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a check issued to pay an obligation arising from a transaction that was illegal in the jurisdiction of the State or district attorney at the time the check was made, drawn, or delivered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State or district attorney</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term “State or district attorney” means the chief elected or appointed prosecuting attorney in a district, county (as defined in <uscode edition="2009" section="2" title="1">section 2 of title 1</uscode>), municipality, or comparable jurisdiction, including State attorneys general who act as chief elected or appointed prosecuting attorneys in a district, county (as so defined), municipality or comparable jurisdiction, who may be referred to by a variety of titles such as district attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, commonwealth's attorneys, solicitors, county attorneys, and state's attorneys, and who are responsible for the prosecution of State crimes and violations of jurisdiction-specific local ordinances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prepare an analysis of economic impact which considers the costs and benefits to financial institutions, consumers, and other users of electronic fund transfers, including the extent to which additional documentation, reports, records, or other paper work would be required, and the effects upon competition in the provision of electronic banking services among large and small financial institutions and the availability of such services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent practicable, the Board shall demonstrate that the consumer protections of the proposed regulations outweigh the compliance costs imposed upon consumers and financial institutions, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of model clauses</h4>

Such model clauses shall be adopted after notice duly given in the Federal Register and opportunity for public comment in accordance with <uscode edition="2009" section="553" title="5">section 553 of title 5</uscode>. With respect to the disclosures required by section 1693c(a)(3) and (4) of this title, the Board shall take account of variations in the services and charges under different electronic fund transfer systems and, as appropriate, shall issue alternative model clauses for disclosure of these differing account terms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Regulations prescribed hereunder may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of electronic fund transfers, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.

The financial institution may require written confirmation to be provided to it within ten business days of an oral notification of error if, when the oral notification is made, the consumer is advised of such requirement and the address to which such confirmation should be sent. A financial institution which requires written confirmation in accordance with the previous sentence need not provisionally recredit a consumer's account in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, nor shall the financial institution be liable under subsection (e) of this section if the written confirmation is not received within the ten-day period referred to in the previous sentence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unauthorized electronic fund transfers; limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer shall be liable for any unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the account of such consumer only if the card or other means of access utilized for such transfer was an accepted card or other meanas <sup><a href="#1693g_1_target" name="1693g_1">1</a></sup> of access and if the issuer of such card, code, or other means of access has provided a means whereby the user of such card, code, or other means of access can be identified as the person authorized to use it, such as by signature, photograph, or fingerprint or by electronic or mechanical confirmation. In no event, however, shall a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer exceed the lesser of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $50; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of money or value of property or services obtained in such unauthorized electronic fund transfer prior to the time the financial institution is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of, circumstances which lead to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account has been or may be effected. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient when such steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the financial institution with the pertinent information, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the financial institution does in fact receive such information.</p>
<br class="Q04"/>
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report within sixty days of transmittal of the statement (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a reasonable time under the circumstances) any unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error which appears on the periodic statement provided to the consumer under <uscode edition="2009" section="1693d" title="15">section 1693d of this title</uscode>. In addition, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses which the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report any loss or theft of a card or other means of access within two business days after the consumer learns of the loss or theft (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a longer period which is reasonable under the circumstances), but the consumer's liability under this subsection in any such case may not exceed a total of $500, or the amount of unauthorized electronic fund transfers which occur following the close of two business days (or such longer period) after the consumer learns of the loss or theft but prior to notice to the financial institution under this subsection, whichever is less.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1281 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action which involves a consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the electronic fund transfer was authorized or, if the electronic fund transfer was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to establish that the conditions of liability set forth in subsection (a) of this section have been met, and, if the transfer was initiated after the effective date of <uscode edition="2009" section="1693c" title="15">section 1693c of this title</uscode>, that the disclosures required to be made to the consumer under section 1693c(a)(1) and (2) of this title were in fact made in accordance with such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of limitation on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a transaction which involves both an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and an extension of credit as defined in <uscode detail="(e)" edition="2009" section="1602" title="15">section 1602(e) of this title</uscode> pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn, the limitation on the consumer's liability for such transaction shall be determined solely in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restriction on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a consumer for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer in excess of his liability for such a transfer under other applicable law or under any agreement with the consumer's financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Scope of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, a consumer incurs no liability from an unauthorized electronic fund transfer.</p>
