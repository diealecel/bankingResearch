§2701. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
(a) The Congress finds that—
(1) the Nation is in a severe recession and that the sharp downturn in economic activity has driven large numbers of workers into unemployment and has reduced the incomes of many others;
(2) as a result of these adverse economic conditions the capacity of many homeowners to continue to make mortgage payments has deteriorated and may further deteriorate in the months ahead, leading to the possibility of widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes; and
(3) many of these homeowners could retain their homes with temporary financial assistance until economic conditions improve.
(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a standby authority which will prevent widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes resulting from the temporary loss of employment and income through a program of emergency loans and advances and emergency mortgage relief payments to homeowners to defray mortgage expenses.

§2702. Mortgages eligible for assistance
No assistance shall be extended with respect to any mortgage under this chapter unless—
(1) the holder of the mortgage has indicated to the mortgagor its intention to foreclose;
(2) the mortgagor and holder of the mortgage have indicated in writing to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") and to any agency or department of the Federal Government responsible for the regulation of the holder that circumstances (such as the volume of delinquent loans in its portfolio) make it probable that there will be a foreclosure and that the mortgagor is in need of emergency mortgage relief as authorized by this chapter, except that such statement by the holder of the mortgage may be waived by the Secretary if in his judgment such waiver would further the purposes of this chapter;
(3) payments under the mortgage have been delinquent for at least three months;
(4) the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to adverse economic conditions and is financially unable to make full mortgage payments;
(5) there is a reasonable prospect that the mortgagor will be able to make the adjustments necessary for a full resumption of mortgage payments; and
(6) the mortgaged property is the principal residence of the mortgagor.

§2703. Manner of assistance and repayment

(a) Form of assistance
Assistance under this chapter with respect to a mortgage which meets the requirements of section 2702 of this title may be provided in the form of emergency mortgage relief loans and advances of credit insured pursuant to section 2704 of this title or in the form of emergency mortgage relief payments made by the Secretary pursuant to section 2705 of this title.

(b) Amount of assistance
Assistance under this chapter on behalf of a homeowner may be made available in an amount up to the amount of the principal, interest, taxes, ground rents, hazard insurance, and mortgage insurance premiums due under the homeowner's mortgage, but such assistance shall not exceed the lesser of $250 per month or the amount determined to be reasonably necessary to supplement such amount as the homeowner is capable of contributing toward such mortgage payment.

(c) Monthly payments; extension of time; report of increase in income
Monthly payments may be provided under this chapter either with the proceeds of an insured loan or advance of credit or with emergency mortgage relief payments for up to twelve months, and, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary, such monthly payments may be extended once for up to twelve additional months. A mortgagor receiving the benefit of mortgage relief assistance pursuant to this chapter shall be required, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary, to report any increase in income which will permit a reduction or termination of such assistance during this period.

(d) Conditions and terms of repayment; interest rate
Emergency loans or advances of credit made and insured under section 2704 of this title, and emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title, shall be repayable by the homeowner upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe, except that interest on a loan or advance of credit insured under section 2704 of this title or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title shall not be charged at a rate which exceeds the maximum interest rate applicable with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to section 1709(b) of this title.

(e) Deferral of commencement of repayment; security for repayment
The Secretary may provide for the deferral of the commencement of the repayment of a loan or advance insured under section 2704 of this title or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title until one year following the date of the last disbursement of the proceeds of the loan or advance or payments or for such longer period as the Secretary determines would further the purpose of this chapter. The Secretary shall by regulation require such security for the repayment of insured loans or advances of credit or emergency mortgage relief payments as he deems appropriate and may require that such repayment be secured by a lien on the mortgaged property.

§2704. Insurance for emergency mortgage loans and advances

(a) Institutions eligible
The Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to insure banks, trust companies, finance companies, mortgage companies, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, credit unions, and such other financial institutions, which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience and facilities and approves as eligible for insurance, against losses which they may sustain as a result of emergency loans or advances of credit made in accordance with the provisions of section 2703 of this title and this section with respect to mortgages eligible for assistance under this chapter.

(b) Amount of insurance
In no case shall the insurance granted by the Secretary under this section to any financial institution on loans and advances made by such financial institution for the purposes of this chapter exceed 40 per centum of the total amount of such loans and advances made by the institution, except that, with respect to any individual loan or advance of credit, the amount of any claim for loss on such individual loan or advance of credit paid by the Secretary under the provision of this section shall not exceed 90 per centum of such loss.

(c) Premium charge; amount
The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge or charges for the insurance granted under this section, but in the case of any loan or advance of credit, such charge or charges shall not exceed an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum of the principal obligation of such loan or advance of credit outstanding at any time.

(d) Waiver of compliance with rules and regulations; finality and incontestability of payment for loss; transfer of insurance
The Secretary is authorized and empowered to waive compliance with any rule or regulation prescribed by the Secretary for the purposes of this section if, in the Secretary's judgment, the enforcement of such rule or regulation would impose an injustice upon an insured lending institution which has substantially complied with such regulations in good faith. Any payment for loss made to an insured financial institution under this section shall be final and incontestable after two years from the date the claim was certified for payment by the Secretary, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such institution unless a demand for repurchase of the obligation shall have been made on behalf of the United States prior to the expiration of such two-year period. The Secretary is authorized to transfer to any financial institution approved for insurance under this chapter any insurance in connection with any loan which may be sold to it by another insured financial institution.

(e) Maximum aggregate amount of loans and advances insured
The aggregate amount of loans and advances insured under this section shall not exceed $1,500,000,000 at any one time.
"(e) The Secretary shall establish underwriting guidelines or procedures to allocate amounts made available for loans and advances insured under this section and for emergency relief payments made under section 2705 of this title based on the likelihood that a mortgagor will be able to resume mortgage payments, pursuant to the requirement under section 2702(5) of this title."

§2705. Emergency mortgage relief payments

§2709. Waiver and relaxation by institutions and approved mortgagees of limitations with respect to mortgage delinquencies; notification to Federal supervisory agency prior to foreclosure proceedings
Each Federal supervisory agency with respect to financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction, and the Secretary, with respect to other approved mortgagees, shall (1) prior to October 1, 1977, take appropriate action, not inconsistent with laws relating to the safety or soundness of such institutions or mortgagee, as the case may be, to waive or relax limitations pertaining to the operations of such institutions or mortgagees with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to cause or encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and (2) until one year from July 2, 1975, request each such institution or mortgagee to notify that Federal supervisory agency, the Secretary, and the mortgagor, at least thirty days prior to instituting foreclosure proceedings in connection with any mortgage loan.

§2711. Nonapplicability of other laws
Notwithstanding any provision of law which limits the nature, amount, term, form, or rate of interest, or the nature, amount, or form of security of loans or advances of credit, loans, or advances of credit may be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter without regard to such provision of law.
